- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?

**Everybody ready to go with this?**

- **Outline in hand?**
