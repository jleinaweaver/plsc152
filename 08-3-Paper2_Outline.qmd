1. In getting them tready to give each other feedback on the outlines make sure to emphasize that each theory must be explained (with source citation) BEFORE application

## For Today: Draft an Outline {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .smaller}

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 1: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?

::: notes
**Everybody ready to go with this?**

- **Outline in hand?**

<br>

Ok, time to get some feedback!

Today you will get feedback from two people and have a chance to revise your outline to reflect that feedback.

In a moment I'll split you into pairs...
:::



## Review the Outlines in Pairs {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Person 1: Present your Outline**

::: notes
Person 1 presents their paper outline

## Review the Outlines in Pairs {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Person 1: Present your Outline**

**Person 2: To be convincing to you...**

+ Is EACH theory applied correctly?

+ Is EACH theory evaluated using the same criteria?

+ What evidence is needed to support this evaluation?

::: notes
**Person 2 gives feedback focused on helping person 1 make it more convincing**

<br>

This criteria piece is new

- Two key elements to make this a coherent argument paper

1. A strong thesis statement that carries through the whole paper, and

2. Each theory should be evaluated using the same criteria
    - Need this to tie all the pieces together clearly.

### Questions on this?

*YOU:* Make sure to do this 2x!

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 1: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?

::: notes
Now that you've heard some more arguments and gotten feedback on yours it's time to revise.

- Reflect on the feedback, revise your outline and start writing!

- Tighten up those premises

<br>

### Why don't we need a counter-argument paragraph here?

- (Critical analysis through the whole thing!)

<br>

Paper is due next week!
