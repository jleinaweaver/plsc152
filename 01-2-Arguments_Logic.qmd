## Unpacking an Argument {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"  .center}

![](Images/01_1-woman-desk-paperwork.webp){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes
**Before we talk about the arguments themselves, how did the task go for you?**

- **How often have you been asked to do this kind of exercise before?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start by talking about the quality of an argument.
:::



## {background-image="Images/01_2-Girl_yells_yak.jpg"  .center}

::: notes

Bad arguments are everywhere and are common in the political arena.

- In fact, when you say "politics" I think many people's minds go to something like this.

- Clearly this is not what we aspire to.

<br>

**How do you, personally, judge whether an argument is "good" or "bad"?**

- **In other words, in your mind what are the characteristics of a good argument?**

<br>

In academic terms, our definition of a good argument tends to focus on whether it convinces you of its thesis

- **What is a thesis?**

    - (The central idea of your argument.)
    
    - The thing you want people to take away from it.

<br>

**When was the last time in your life someone changed your mind about something with an argument? Examples?**

<br>

**How specifically did they do it? Certain strategies employed?**

<br>

While being "convincing" is the goal, that's also a subjective test of quality.

- In academia we have developed criteria that we argue are necessary for an argument to be convincing.

:::
 

## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: notes

For the important arguments in our lives, concerning the issues we care most about, people demand you put in some serious work to shift their position.

<br>

Let's talk through each of these elements.

- FYI this is the rubric I use when grading argument papers in my classes.
:::


## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.incremental}
- **Logical** arguments support their conclusion with well specified premises.

- **Clear** arguments are easy to read & understand.

- **Credible** arguments use high quality evidence and citations.

- **Critical** arguments acknowledge the limitations of evidence and address counter-arguments.
:::

::: notes

The rubric is in the syllabus so you can consult it as you write and revise for this class.

- The key is, a convincing academic argument must do ALL FOUR OF THESE THINGS well.

<br>

**What questions do you have about this rubric?**

- **Which elements need more explanation?**

<br>

During the course of the semester we will spend time exploring each of these criteria.

- For today our focus is primarily on logic and clarity.

## Argument Basics: Logic {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

![](Images/01_2-Labossiere-header.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: {.incremental}
- Conclusion

- Premise

- Inductive Arguments
:::

::: notes
I want to use the Labossiere reading to highlight the key components of a high quality argument.

- Again, these are the elements you will need to write papers and make arguments in this class.

<br>

**REVEAL: According to Labossiere (2008), what is the conclusion of an argument?**

+ (This is the main point of the argument, e.g. the thesis or key takeaway)

<br>

**REVEAL: According to Labossiere (2008), what is a premise?**

+ (A premise is a claim given as evidence or a reason for accepting the conclusion.)

- So, the basic structure of every logical argument is a series of premises that support a conclusion.

<br>

REVEAL: Induction represents how we think about the quality of the connection between our premises and our conclusion.

- In this class, and throughout the social sciences, we tend to rely on inductive reasoning.

- This is a form of reasoning that moves from the specific to the general

- e.g. An argument that provides a series of empirical observations that all support a more general conclusion
    
<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's look at some examples
:::



## Inductive Arguments {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**From the Specific to the General**

<br>

- Premise 1

- Premise 2

- Premise 3

Conclusion

::: notes

This is the structure we'll use for diagramming the logic of an argument in this class

- A series of premises listed as bullets leading to a conclusion

<br>

**SLIDE**: Inductive example 1

:::




## Inductive Arguments {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**From the Specific to the General**

<br>

- Every cat that you've observed purrs.

Therefore, all cats purr.

::: notes

The premise comes from your specific experience.

- All the cats you've seen have purred

- Premises don't just have to be based on your experience, but this is how most reasoning you do day-to-day happens

<br>

The conclusion is you drawing an inference about the wider population from those experiences

- Assuming the cats you've seen represent all the cats in the world, then you reach this inductive conclusion

<br>

**Make sense?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Example 2

:::



## Inductive Arguments {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**From the Specific to the General**

<br>

- All the children in this daycare center like to play with Lego. 

Therefore, all children like to play with Lego.

::: notes

Again, we build the argument using a specific premise and use it to support a general, or broader, conclusion.

<br>

**Does everyone see how each of these arguments build from a specific premise to a general conclusion?**

- Inductive arguments use specific premises to support a more general conclusion

- Inductive arguments often make claims about the future based on the way things have typically happened in the past

<br>

**SLIDE** Strength of an inductive argument

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Quality of Inductive Arguments: Weak to Strong**
:::

<br>

- Every cat that you've observed purrs. 

Therefore, all cats must purr.

<br>

- All the children in this daycare center like to play with Lego. 

Therefore, all children like to play with Lego.

::: notes

Inductive arguments can also be classified along a continuum of weak to strong.

<br>

A "strong" inductive argument "succeeds in having its conclusion be probably true, given the truth of the premises" ([Critical thinking book](https://iu.pressbooks.pub/shockeyphilp102summer/chapter/inductive-arguments/)).

- In other words, if we assume these premises are true is the conclusion more likely to be true.

<br>

**Are all of these "strong" inductive arguments? Why or why not?**

- (**SLIDE**: Could be stronger with probabilistic language!)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The Quality of Inductive Arguments: Weak to Strong**
:::

<br>

- Every cat that you've observed purrs. 

Therefore, ~~all~~ **most** cats **likely** purr.

<br>

- All the children in this daycare center like to play with Lego. 

Therefore, ~~all~~ **most** children **probably** like to play with Lego.

::: notes

**Does everybody understand why these are stronger inductive arguments?**

<br>

Our premises in the social sciences can NEVER definitively prove something

1. We build from evidence which means our arguments can always get stronger, and

2. Human behavior is probabilistic, not deterministic

    - Our theories focus on human tendencies not hard and fast rules
    
<br>

Put these elements together and this means that our conclusions are ALWAYS uncertain

<br>

Keep in mind: strong inductive arguments DOES NOT MEAN convincing!

- You're making an educated or informed guess based on the information or data that you have.

- No amount of supporting observations can EVER prove an inductive argument.

    - It's all about strength of the argument, never certainty

## To be convincing an argument should be logical, clear, credible and critical {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

The Components of a Logical Argument:

+ Conclusion

+ Premise(s)

+ Inductive Reasoning (in this class)
:::

::: notes

So, this represents the crux of the "logic" portion of our class writing rubric.

<br>

The arguments you make in this class must be logical and that means they are:

- Designed to advance a single, clear conclusion,

- Built upon clear, well supported premises, and

- Inductively strong.

<br>

**Questions on any of this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's apply these elements to the arguments I had you evaluate before class.
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_2-Kramer2025.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Ok, the first argument we need to evaluate was written by Karen Kramer. [Bio](https://iranhumanrights.org/bio-karen-kramer/)

- Ms. Kramer is deputy director of the Center for Human Rights in Iran.

- She has previously taught Middle East politics, acted as a private consultant and served as executive editor of the MidEast Report

<br>

**ALWAYS important to think about who is making the argument and what motivates them!**

<br>

**Before digging into the argument itself, anything about this source we should keep in mind? Any concerns?**
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"}

::: {.r-fit-text}
What is the conclusion of this argument?
:::

![](Images/01_2-Kramer2025.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Let's start by identifying the central conclusion in the argument.

<br>

**So, what's the conclusion of the argument?**

- **What is she trying to convince us to do?**

- (**SLIDE**)
:::

![](Images/01_2-Kramer2025.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

Therefore, the international community must immediately respond to the crackdown on dissent by Iran's government.

::: notes

This represents my summary of the central argument here.

<br>

**Everybody ok with using this as our target?**

- **Any tweaks needed?**

<br>

Take a few minutes on your own to identify the THREE most important premises in the article.

- Try to think about this from a 30,000 foot view
- What are the big reasons he gives to support the conclusion?
- Each paragraph in the argument either reveals a premise or explains and supports a premise.
- Your first job is to find the premises.

<br>

**Questions?**

Let's get to it!

<br>

Compare your list of premises to the person next to you.

<br>

Alright, let's get ideas up *ON THE BOARD*

- *Call on people, chance to learn names*

- **SLIDE**: My version

<br>

**Notes**

- The current "crackdown" against dissent by the Iranian government violates many human rights
    - Examples: No due process, no legal counsel, sham trials, targeting religious minorities, targeting ethnic minorities
- Iran's parliament is now moving to "equate online activism and information sharing with terrorism and treason"
    - "Anyone accused of undermining national security or sharing content with foreign media could face life imprisonment or death."
- If the international community doesn't act then we are "[validating] the regime's strategy" and preventing the creation of a free Iran
- The US has the leverage to act and tools to use: Sanctions, diplomatic isolation, pressure at the UN, universal jurisdiction to prosecute public officials
- Therefore, the international community must immediately respond to the crackdown on dissent by Iran's government.
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

- The Iranian government is attacking its own peoples' human rights

- The Iranian parliament is about to make activism and information sharing terrorism / treason

- If the Iranian government succeeds then they will have killed the roots of a free, future Iran

- The US has the leverage to act and the international community has many tools available

Therefore, the international community must immediately respond to the crackdown on dissent by Iran's government.

::: notes
**Per the rubric, are these premises clear?**

**Is the argument inductively logical? Why or why not?**

<br>

Let's talk evidence.

**What evidence does the author provide to support the first premise?**

- **Is it high quality and cited appropriately?**

*Repeat for each additional premise*

<br>

The final element of the rubric is critical analysis.

**Is there any critical analysis in the argument (e.g. counter-arguments or acknowledging limitations in evidence)?**

<br>

Ok let's talk.

**Are you convinced by this argument? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Any questions on the procedure for diagramming and evaluating an academic argument?**

- **SLIDE**: Let's practice this again!

![](Images/01_2-VanReybrouck.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Our second argument comes from David Van Reybrouck, a philosopher and historian

- Much published author and the official philosopher laureate of the Netherlands

<br>

**Before digging into the argument itself, anything about this source or type of source we should keep in mind?**

- **Any concerns?**

Therefore, the world must do something about our gerontocracy 
:::

::: notes

**Everybody ok with using this as our target?**

- **Any tweaks needed or requested?**

- (Gerontocracy: government based on rule by old people)

<br>

Alright, 30,000 foot view.

**What are the key premises in this argument?**

- *if enough time have them work on their own or in pairs first.*

- *ON BOARD*

<br>

**SLIDE**: My version

**Notes**

- Leaders around the world are getting very, very old
    - US, Russia, China, India, Israel, Iran, Turkey, Cameroon
- As they age, these leaders have been more willing to do anything to tighten their grips on power
    - Repression, violence, genocide, ecocide and contempt for international law
- These leaders appear dismissive of the "rules-based international order" and will not live to see the harms they will breed (and do not care)
    - Trump bullies NATO, Putin invades Ukraine, Netanyahu's "war" in Gaza, Xi's pressure on Taiwan
- Nelson Mandela gave us a better model for the positive role an aging leader can have by relinquishing power
- Therefore, the world must do something about our gerontocracy 

:::

- Leaders around the world are getting very, very old
- These older leaders have been willing to do anything to tighten their grips on power
- These older leaders will not live to see the harms they are doing come to fruition (and they don't seem to care)
- Nelson Mandela gave us a better model for the positive role an aging leader can have by relinquishing power

Therefore, the world must do something about our gerontocracy

## {background-image="Images/01_2-globe_and_lights.jpg"}

::: notes

Our job over the next three classes is to lay the foundations we need to study international relations this semester.

- That will mean defining our key concepts, 

- discussing the "science" in political science, and 

- exploring the use of models for explaining events.

<br>

For next class we start by trying to define the most important concepts of our semester.

- What are these "international political events" we are trying to explain?

- In other words, what are we doing here?
:::



## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

### Case Study:

- Find and submit a recent "international political event"

- Details on Canvas

::: notes

**Check the syllabus and Canvas modules and report back!**

<br>

Find a recent "international political event" described in the news. 
- No overlapping events! First-come, first-served! 

1. An APA citation for your source 

2. Explain why this event is "international" (at least 1-2 sentences) 

3. Explain why this event is "political" (at least 1-2 sentences) 

4. Explain why this event is "specific" (at least 1-2 sentences).


<br>

**Has anybody ever used APA formatting for references and citations before?**

That's what we'll be using in this class (and all the social sciences).

- If you're not sure how, follow the link to the Purdue OWL in the syllabus!

<br>

Submit your chosen event to Canvas before class.

- Answer must be specific and at least 2 complete sentences

- NO OVERLAP!

<br>
