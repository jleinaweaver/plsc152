## Assignment for Today {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Claim a democracy and a dictatorship (first-come, first-served) and review their current human rights record using:

1. The country reports by the US Department of State
2. The country reports by Amnesty International
3. The country reports by Human Rights Watch

Submit a summary of each country to Canvas before class (2-3 sentences each)

::: notes

For today I asked each of you to perform two case studies that would help us think about the state of human rights in the world.

### Everybody ready to go?
:::



## A Case Study {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

"A case study is an **in-depth examination**, often undertaken over time, of **a single case** – such as a policy, programme, intervention site, implementation process or participant" (Goodrick 2014, 1).

::: notes

Your work for today is what we refer to as a "case study."

- Although, to be fair to what we did, we did a very brief case study at a single moment in recent time...

- Still, I think you get the gist.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Thanks to all of your work before class, we can now use our time in class to perform a comparative case analysis.
:::


## A Comparative Case Study {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

"Comparative case studies involve the **analysis and synthesis of the similarities, differences and patterns across two or more cases** that share a common focus or goal in a way that **produces knowledge** that is easier to generalize about causal questions – how and why particular programmes or policies work or fail to work" (Goodrick 2014).

::: notes

In other words, comparing all of your cases allows us to:

1. Broaden our descriptive knowledge of the world,

2. Identify puzzles that need some explanation (generates new research projects), and

3. Develop generalizations about how certain mechanisms or processes might work.

<br>

I'm hoping we can do some of all three of those things today.

::: notes

*NOTE TO YOU: Shorten discussion of bias in the sources*

<br>

Before we dig into the cases, let's talk about our data sources.

- Heading into areas we know nothing about puts even more pressure on us to build knowledge using "high quality" sources.

- **So, what concerns do you have about using these three data sources for learning about human rights behaviors around the world?**

<br>

Key lesson: There is "bias" or "perspective" in everything, but that's not a deal-breaker!

- All rulers are imperfect, but we can still learn something about the world using that ruler

- The measurements only have meaning given the context of the ruler you are using!

- Science means being transparent about the quality of your ruler and acknowledging the uncertainty in using it

<br>

We did this on Friday with the UN DHR!

- We used that treaty as a tool for measuring the behavior of America

- Whether we like the treaty or not, it let us measure something useful about American behavior

<br>

I'll be totally honest with you here: Each of these sources has its own problems

- The US State Dept is explicitly a political entity with a very specific perspective

- Both AI and HRW are NGOs that face funding pressures and must be careful to ensure access to the places they want to do work in.

<br>

### So, what is our best bet for establishing "high confidence" facts from these three sources?

(Most confident where all three reports agree with each other?)
- This assumes all three asking the same question, right?

(Least confident when:)
- only one mentions something,
- when a "fact" lies at the heart of the source's bias,

## Analyze the Democracy Cases {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.fragment}
- In general, how good is the respect for human rights in these cases?
  	- Excellent
    - Good
    - Fair
    - Poor

- Most targeted groups?

- Most violated rights?
:::

::: notes

*Split into four groups (preserve board space)*

- Try to work with new people!

- Work directly on the board!

- Your job is to compare and contrast the democracy cases and get ready to report back your findings.

<br>

**REVEAL**: Before you get to work let's make sure we're clear on the "ruler" we're using!

- **GROUPS, take a moment to get on the same page re how to apply this short Likert scale.**

- **Get ready to report back to the class how you plan on classifying a country on this scale**

<br>

*REPORT back and DISCUSS*

- (Human rights respect as)

    - number of violations? 
    
    - severity of violations?
    
    - efforts by the state to correct/prevent violations?

<br>

Ok, get to work!

- Work directly on the board!

<br>

**Any early conclusions we can draw at this point about human rights practices in democracies?**

- *Report Back and Discuss*

## Analyze the Dictatorship Cases {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

- In general, how good is the respect for human rights in these cases?
  	- Excellent
    - Good
    - Fair
    - Poor

- Most targeted groups?

- Most violated rights?

::: notes

Mix up the groups!

- Go work with new people!

<br>

Groups, compare and contrast the dictatorship cases and get ready to report back your findings.

- Work directly on the board!

## Based on our comparative case study, is regime type a useful predictor of human rights around the world? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: notes

**Based on this comparative case study how comfortable are you in asserting that regime type is a predictor of human rights behavior?**

- **Why or why not?**

<br>

**Do the regime types differ significantly in terms of their most common "human rights" violations?**

<br>

**Do the regime types differ significantly in terms of who specifically in the country is doing the harms?**

<br>

**Do the regime types differ significantly in terms of how the victims are being targeted?**

<br>

**Any evidence in the cases of any of these identified harms being addressed?**

<br>

SLIDE: Let's look at some more comprehensive data on this question
:::




## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem) Civil Liberties Index**
:::

- Freedom from political killings
- Freedom from torture
- Freedom of expression
- Freedom of discussion
- Government censorship
- Harassment of journalists
- Barriers to opposition parties
- Freedom of movement (domestic and international)
- Freedom of religion
- Freedom from forced labor

::: notes

The V-Dem project is a massive research effort undertaken by scholars around the world to measure many, many aspects of states and people.

<br>

For example, these are the broad components of a measure they have constructed called "the Civil Liberties Index"

- Big Picture: "Civil liberty is constituted by the absence of physical violence committed by government agents and the absence of constraints of private liberties and political liberties by the government" (V-Dem Codebook, 301).

<br>

**What do you think of using these as the key components of measuring civil liberties around the world?**

- **Anything here you think doesn't belong?**

<br>

**Anything missing you think is important based on your review of the cases for today?**

<br>

SLIDE: The world in 2023...

![](Images/12_1-civil-liberties-index-2024.png)

::: notes

Here are the V-Dem measurements of civil liberties around the world in 2023.

- Each country gets a score running from 0 (low) to 1 (high)

- We can kind of think of these like country grades from 0% to 100%

<br>

FIRST, audit your case studies on the map.

- **Do you broadly agree with the kind of grade your two countries received here? Why or why not?**

<br>

SECOND, back to our big question.

- **Based on this global data, how comfortable are you in asserting that regime type is a predictor of human rights behavior?**

:::




## {background-image="Images/12_1-Team_America.jpg"}

::: notes

Last big question for us today.

<br>

### Do you think human rights violations should compel American action?

### - Should we be the world's policeman when human rights are under assault? Why or why not?
:::



## {background-image="Images/12_1-Fragile_States2024.png" background-size='85%'}

::: notes

The question might not be so cut and dry.

<br>

Here we see the Fragile States Index.

- Some have demonstrated that states with increasing levels of human rights violations raise their risk of failure (e.g. governmental collapse).

- And state failures tend not to stay isolated within their borders, e.g. one failed state tends to destabilize those around them.

- Therefore, preventing small conflicts from becoming wider wars may require earlier interference in states when human rights violations increase.

<br>

**Does this change how you answer the question about American involvement in conflicts overseas? Why or why not?**
