Prep for Class

1. Review canvas submissions

2. Markers needed for each group (x4)

3. Bring pennies for the mixed strategy group

<br>

Today I'd like us to explore PD strategies and what those strategies tell us about real world situations.

- My apologies for being vague...

<br>

**Refresh my memory, what is the dilemma that the Prisoner's Dilemma model is meant to help us understand?**

- (Why is it so hard for groups to cooperate under certain conditions?)
- (When goods are rivalrous and uncertainty is high, actors who prefer cooperation may still choose to defect!)

<br>

### What are the key assumptions in this model of IR?

- (**SLIDE**)
:::



## The Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .smaller}

<br>

**Interests:** 

- Rational individuals pursuing "gains"

**Institutions:**

- No restrictions on choosing defect or cooperate
- High uncertainty (e.g. simultaneous decisions, unknown time horizons)
- Benefits depend on choices of all actors

**Interactions:**

- Biggest rewards for short-term defection OR long-term cooperation

- A risk averse actor's dominant strategy is to defect

::: notes
**Questions on this model?**

Notes:

- Rational = Acts in accordance with transitive and ordered preferences

- Two sources of uncertainty: Unknown time horizons (how many rounds to play), simultaneous decision-making

- Non-excludable = Anyone can access it / hard to prevent access

- Rivalrous = Your use changes reward to other side

<br>

Here we see the PD game's answer to the question, why is international cooperation hard?

- Some international problems are structured in such a way that they make cooperation very hard to achieve (even when cooperating would make everyone better off!)

- Problems that look like THIS often lead to bad outcomes EVEN THOUGH all involved would like to cooperate!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today I'd like us to explore strategies for dealing with prisoner's dilemmas.

- Play 10 rounds

- No negotiation / no talking

- Your goal is to maximize YOUR points
:::


::: notes

I've updated the outcomes table since the last time we played.

<br>

**Everybody still clear on how to read this game board?**

<br>

In short, I've maintained the same Nash Equilibrium that gives us a dominant strategy of defection

- However, I've also increased the margins so each play of the game has bigger consequences for the players

<br>

**REVEAL**: As a warm-up let's pair off and play this new PD table

- Pairs, I'd like you to play the game 10 times and we'll see who can accrue the most points in the class

- For this version of the game there is no talking / negotiating allowed between or during rounds

- Your goal is to maximize your points

    - Our work today is focused on tactics, NOT differences in actor preferences

<br>

**SLIDE**: Here's how to track the game

::::

::: notes

EACH player needs their own sheet of paper for tracking the game

- On your sheet make a list from 1-10 with space for your decision and points earned each round

- Each round each player makes their decision, defect or cooperate, and writes it on the paper next to the number for the round

- **Both written down THEN simultaneously reveal your choices**

- Tally up the points and move to the next round

<br>

Key here is that there is NO NEGOTIATING allowed!

- We're exploring tactics today focused on the rules of the game itself.

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

**Who were the top point getters in the class?**

**Can we solve the prisoner's dilemma?**

::: {.incremental}
1. Always cooperate

2. Always defect

3. The grim trigger

4. Tit for tat

5. Mixed
:::
:::

::: notes
Game theorists of every stripe, e.g. political scientists, economists, etc, have been working to untangle the prisoner's dilemma for years

- Tons of research, experiments, computer simulations and new theory have been thrown at the problem in an effort to "solve" the dilemma

<br>

Let's discuss five "pure" strategies to the Prisoner's dilemma.

- **REVEAL x 5**

1. Always cooperate means you cooperate every round, no matter what.

2. Always defect means you defect every round, no matter what.

3. The grim trigger means you cooperate in round 1 and then keep cooperating UNTIL the other side defects

    - Once the other side defects, you defect FOREVER

    - Defection triggers a grim outcome, no?
    
4. Tit for tat means you cooperate in the first round and then, starting in round 2, you do whatever the other person did last round

    - If they cooperated in round 1, you cooperate in round 2

    - If they defected in round 1, you defect in round 2

5. In a mixed strategy you randomize your choice of cooperate and defect each round regardless of what the other player does

    - This can be done by assigning a probability distribution to your choices (e.g. 50-50, 60-40, 70-30, etc)

<br>

**Is everybody clear on how to implement each of these strategies?**

- **If I assigned you one, do you understand how it would make you play the game?**

<br>

*Split the class into FIVE groups, one group per strategy*

<br>

Go sit with your groups and make sure you have space on the board for recording results

::: notes
Groups, your job is to test YOUR strategy against all of the others

- We need to know how many points YOUR strategy is worth when it goes up against each of the other strategies

- I will ask you to test your strategy against each of the others 10x and record the result on the board

- You should also test your strategy against itself!

<br>

**Big picture, does what I'm asking you to do make sense?**

- You don't need to record the points "won" by the other group

- **Mixed group, I will ask you to cooperate in round 1 and then alternate defect and cooperate each round after that**

<br>

**Questions?**

- Get to work!

<br>

*Results table at bottom so you can check their work as they go*

*When everyone is done have each group analyze their results BEFORE reporting back*

2. Who do you want to avoid (negative outcomes)?

3. How many types give you a positive return?

::: notes

Note: I implemented the "mixed" strategy here by simply flipping from co-op to defect each round

- Not actually a random choice here...

<br>

**Groups, what is the minimum, the maximum and the mean result across the five strategies for you?**

<br>

**Ok, where do we end up?**

- **Which is your best strategy if you don't know the "type" of your opponent?**

<br>

**Could we mix any of these strategies to make them more effective?**

- **e.g. lengthen the punishment of tit for tat?**

For pre-class today I asked each of you to analyze the events in the Smale and Shear article using the PD model

- Assignment prompt: Use the interests, institutions and interactions of a Prisoner's Dilemma to explain the events in Smale and Shear (2014). (2+ sentences)

<br>

Discuss the event with your group and get ready to report back to me

- **Is the PD model a useful way of explaining this event? Why or why not?**

<br>

**In what ways does this event match the assumptions of the PD theory?**

- Rational actors pursuing gains?

- No restrictions on choosing defect or cooperate?

- High uncertainty (e.g. simultaneous decisions, unknown time horizons)?

- Benefits depend on choices of all actors?

- Biggest rewards for short-term defection OR long-term cooperation?

- A risk averse actor’s dominant strategy is to defect?

<br>

**What strategies are being attempted here by each set of actors?**

<br>

**Did this act work to change Russian behavior? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Was this the right strategy given the features of this PD structure? Why or why not?**
