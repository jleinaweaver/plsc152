Prep for Class

1. Bring playing cards to class

2. Make sure to keep things moving to cover all exercises
    - Refresher on science
    - Why wars?
    - Survive or die game
    - Introduce IIIs
    - Diagram neorealism
    - Step through security dilemma illustration

<br>

Reminder: Paper is due Friday!

<br>

*Opening Discussion: From this point forward students need to practice identifying international political events everyday in class. These are more than just 'things happening far away'!*

### DISCUSS: Name me an international political event that has happened since we last met as a class.

<br>

For the rest of this week we dive into our first set of International Relations theories: Neorealism and Offensive Realism.

- Maybe they can help us understand the world!

<br>

**SLIDE**: First things first, our focus in IR is on explaining international political events!
:::




## The Outcome to Explain {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**International**

- Global impact or involving more than one state

**Political**

- Decision-making in a community
- How we make and enforce "the rules"
- Who gets what, when and how?

**Event**

- A thing or happening

::: notes

As your first papers are ongoing let's check in on this

- **Is everybody clear that they are working on a SINGLE, DISTINCT international political event for the paper?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: The plan for the semester
:::



## Semester Outline {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Section 1: Arguments, Evidence and International Relations

<br>

**Section 2: Why Are There Wars?**

<br>

Section 3: Why is it so Hard to Cooperate With Other Countries?

<br>

Section 4: What is the Future of Transnational Politics and IR?

::: notes

Today we start section 2 of our class which is focused on trying to answer a really big question: Why Are There Wars?

<br>

**Why is the existence of war in international politics a puzzle?**

- (**SLIDE**)
:::



## {background-image="Images/06_1-WW1.jpg" .center}

::: notes

The question of "why do wars happen?" is actually a MUCH tougher to answer than you might think.

- Wars are IMMENSELY costly in terms of blood and treasure

<br>

World War I Example

- 4 years, approx 30 countries

- Nearly 10 million soldiers killed, 21 million wounded

- Costs hundreds of billions of dollars

- Leads to the collapse of four empires

    - The Russian Empire, the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Ottoman Empire

- Results in the Bolsheviks taking over Russia and fascists taking over Italy

- Spreads the flu epidemic that killed 25 million around the world

- and on, and on.

<br>

**What lesson do the countries and leaders of the world learn from all these horrible outcomes?**

- (**SLIDE**: Let's do it again!)
:::



## {background-image="Images/06_1-WW1-2.jpg" .center}

::: notes

And then 20 years later we decided to do it all again! 

<br>

World War 2: 

- kills **MORE** people, 

- costs **MORE** money,

- destroys **MORE** of the global economy

- Pushes us to **develop and USE NUCLEAR WEAPONS**!

<br>

It is the incredible death and destruction of WW1 and WW2 that leads to the birth of International Relations as a subfield of political science.

- The idea is to understand these horrible events so we can prevent them.
:::



## Section 2: Why Are There Wars? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- Neorealism

- Offensive Realism

- Liberal Institutionalism

- Economic Liberalism

- Bargaining Model of War

::: notes

We will explore this question by testing out five IR models that each offer different answers

<br>

Remember, models are like maps

- Not true/false but useful or not

- Purpose-built!

<br>

Each of these will encourage you to answer the big question by emphasizing different important mechanisms in the world.

- Your job as a sharp IR scholar is to understand all of them and the pros and cons of using each to explain the world and make predictions about the future!

<br>

IMPORTANT NOTE: Your notes on these models will almost certainly prove VERY useful on the assignments for this class!

:::



## The Realist Paradigm {background-image="Images/05_2-putin_with_gun_v1.png"}

::: notes

This week we explore our first two models, both of which fit snugly in what we call a realist paradigm.

- In other words, they share similar roots but are both distinct models of IR.

<br>

**SLIDE**: As a segue into Neorealism, let's play a game!
:::




## {background-image="Images/background-space1.jpg" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
<p style="color: white;">**Survive or Die!**</p>
:::

<br>

<p style="color: white;">The object of this game is to survive.</p>

<br>

<p style="color: white;">If you lose your card, you **DIE**</p>

::: notes
*Have someone distribute the cards while you explain the game*

<br>

It's a pretty simple game.

- SLIDE: How it works...
:::


## {background-image="Images/background-space1.jpg" .center}

<p style="color: white;">**Survive or Die!**</p>

<br>

::: {.incremental}
1. <p style="color: white;"> You may challenge anyone to a duel (no refusals)</p>

2. <p style="color: white;"> Duel: Rock-paper-scissors (best 2 out of 3)</p>

3. <p style="color: white;"> Winner survives, loser hands over ONE card</p>

4. <p style="color: white;"> **0 cards left = You're Dead**</p>

5. <p style="color: white;"> At end of game the cards = Bonus Points!</p>
:::

::: notes

Go!

<br>

### Ok, what just happened? Report back!

<br>

A useful way to analyze an event, like our game, is to break down your analysis of it into three parts: the interests, the institutions and the interactions.

- Think of this like learning the alphabet of social science modeling / theory building.
:::



## Frieden, Lake and Schultz (2016) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Interests**

"...[The] preferences of actors over the possible outcomes that might result from their political choices" (45).

::: notes

The first element we should clarify are the interests.

- "…[The] preferences of actors over the possible outcomes that might result from their political choices" (45).

<br>

In other words:

- Who are the actors making the key decisions in this event? AND

- What do they want?

<br>

A useful model of IR should identify the key actors and what they want.

### Questions?

<br>

### In our game who/what were the interests?
:::


## Frieden, Lake and Schultz (2016) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Institutions**

"A set of rules, known and shared by the community, that structure political interactions in particular ways" (67).

::: notes

The second element we should clarify are the institutions

- "A set of rules, known and shared by the community, that structure political interactions in particular ways" (67).

- In other words: What are the important rules that structure the decision-making of the actors you are focusing on?

<br>

A useful model of IR should define the key rules of the system.

### Questions?

<br>

### In our game who/what were the institutions?
:::




## Frieden, Lake and Schultz (2016) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Interactions**

"The ways in which the choices of two or more actors combine to produce political outcomes" (51).

::: notes

The third element we should clarify are the Interactions

- "The ways in which the choices of two or more actors combine to produce political outcomes" (51).

- How does the collision of the interests in a situation complicate things?

- In other words, why can't each actor get what they want from a situation?

<br>

A useful model of IR should define how interactions happen and how they change the game.

### Questions?

<br>

### In our game who/what were the interactions and how did they complicate your decisions?
:::



## Frieden, Lake and Schultz (2016) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Interests**

"...[The] preferences of actors over the possible outcomes that might result from their political choices" (45).

**Interactions**

"The ways in which the choices of two or more actors combine to produce political outcomes" (51).

**Institutions**

"A set of rules, known and shared by the community, that structure political interactions in particular ways" (67).

::: notes

Think of interests, interactions and institutions as a shortcut to designing a model of political behavior.

### Any questions on these three concepts?

<br>

### Do we understand how these help us design a model of behavior or decision-making?

+ The interests tell us who is making the decisions and what they want.

+ The institutions tell us what are the rules that matter.

+ The interactions tells us what happens when these different interests collide.

## Neorealism (Waltz 1988) {background-image="Images/05_2-putin_with_gun_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Let's diagram the model!

+ Who are the key interests?

+ What are the key institutions?

+ What are the primary interactions that matter?

:::

::: notes

On your own, 5 mins, diagram Neorealism as an answer to these three questions

<br>

Consolidate diagrams with the person next to you

<br>

Pairs group up and let's get these diagrams on the board!

<br>

### Groups, report back!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's start with the interests in neorealism
:::



## Neorealism (Waltz 1988) {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Unitary states want security, not power

**Institutions**

- ?

**Interactions**

- ?


::: notes

Let's start by discussing the interests in this model

<br>

**What is meant by a unitary state?**

- **Does it help if I tell you this is often referred to as the black box assumption?**

- (By unitary, we mean forming a single entity.)

- The black box: All of the characteristics of the state (e.g. wealth, regime type, voting system) go inside the box and the lid is closed.

<br>

**Since we cannot see inside the box, should we spend time measuring or debating what is inside?**

- (Nope.)

<br>

**What does 'security, not power' mean?**

- (Power is the means to the end, not the end.)

    - The end is survival

<br>

**What is the counterintuitive conclusion about power raised by Waltz?**

- (Too much power makes you a threat to everyone else!)

<br>

Neorealists focus on states as the key units embedded in the international system.

- HOWEVER, what they care about is the placement of units in the system, NOT by reference to their internal qualities themselves.

- Neorealism is a view of international politics with black boxes of different sizes running into each other on a map of the world.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Institutions next
:::



## Neorealism (Waltz 1988) {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Unitary states want security, not power

**Institutions**

- International anarchy

**Interactions**

- ?

::: notes

Now let's talk about the institutions in Neorealism

<br>

**What is meant by anarchy?**

- (“...absence of a central monopoly of legitimate force.”)

<br>

**What does that mean in practical, real-world terms?**

- (No world police.)

- No actor holds a monopoly (e.g. exclusive control) on the use of legitimate force (e.g. legal / allowable violence)

<br>

**SLIDE**: What does all of this mean for states?

:::



## Neorealism (Waltz 1988) {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Unitary states want security, not power

**Institutions**

- International anarchy

**Interactions**

- You must fend for yourself (threats are everywhere)
- Security dilemmas dominate

::: notes

The final element of this model is the interactions.

<br>

**Why does everything look like a threat to states?**

- Every state will feel more secure in a world where its security is greater than yours

- And, every time a state acts to enhance its own security it impacts your security!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's talk about this Security Dilemma dynamic.

## The Security Dilemma {background-image="Images/02_3-neighbors_v1.png"}

::: notes

One of the key predictions of neorealism is the security dilemma.

<br>

Just because it makes me deeply happy, let me briefly illustrate the security dilemma.

<br>

Imagine new neighbors move in next door to you.

- You don't know them and you're not sure what they are up to so you decide to build a fence.

::: notes

That seems eminently reasonable, right?

From your new neighbors perspective, they just bought their dream house and the day after they moved in their new neighbors build a fence and start watching them suspiciously.

#### How would you react to that?

::: notes

Of course, you buy a guard dog to protect you.

The big, mean guard dog makes you feel much safer.

- No one can get near your house or your family without you knowing about it.

<br>

Unfortunately, your neighbor is terrified of dogs.

- He didn’t like you but had no intention of ever going near your house.

- He starts having nightmares about the dog, so...

<br>

You are now living next to a guy you don’t know very well who has been acting strangely since you moved in and has now bought a gun.

- Your dog stands no chance against a gun and now you are having nightmares about being unsafe.

- You decide the only solution is to up your security!

<br>

If one dog made you feel safe, then...

::: notes

This forces you to do the only logical thing you can.

- Bears...

<br>

This is an example of an arms race created by the security dilemma.

### So, what is the fundamental lesson of a security dilemma?
- (Purely defensive moves look threatening in a world of uncertainty and anarchy.)

- At no point did either you nor your neighbor act with the intention of attacking the other person.

- These were entirely defensive moves only and they still spiral out of control!

<br>

### Do we believe the security dilemma is a useful prediction for state behavior in the world? Why or why not?
:::


## Neorealism (Waltz 1988) {background-image="Images/background-slate_v2.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Unitary states want security, not power

**Institutions**

- International anarchy

**Interactions**

- You must fend for yourself (threats are everywhere)
- Security dilemmas dominate

::: notes

OK, summarize this all for me.

### Per the Neorealist model, how likely is cooperation?
- (1. Cooperation super unlikely)
    - Cooperation hard to start and even harder to maintain.

### What should be the most important part of every state's budget?
- (2. Defense!)
    - States should actively seek to build up their own protections

### How should a state react when a natural disaster strikes in a faraway land? Send aid?
- (3. Aid to people in desperate places unlikely, unless...)

<br>

### As a "map" of international politics, what possibly important things does this leave out?

### - Any key interests, institutions or interactions?

<br>

Connect this to current events for me!

### Examples of current international political events going on in the world that are well explained by this model?
