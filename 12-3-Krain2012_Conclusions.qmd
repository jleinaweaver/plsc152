Prep for Class

1. Review Canvas submissions

<br>

**DISCUSS: Name me an international political event that has happened since we last met as a class.**

<br>

So, pertinent to the Krain paper we had an interesting dynamic play out in the media last year that I want to highlight.

Shortly after taking control of Afghanistan the Taliban proceeded to hunt down and kill anyone they suspected of having collaborated with the Americans or the former government.

### Out of curiosity, and relevant to the Krain article, do we count this newspaper report as a "win" for human rights watch? Why or why not?

Days later we saw big announcements come out of the UN General Assembly.

### One hell of a coincidence, no?

<br>

### What evidence would you need to see to convince you that these two events are connected?

#### - That Human Rights Watch succeeded in stopping the UN from recognizing the Taliban?

*DISCUSS*

<br>

Bringing this forward in time:

1. As of Dec 2023 the United Nations Credentials Committee had postponed the decision on handing over Afghanistanâ€™s seat in the UN to the Taliban THREE times [LINK](https://www.afintl.com/en/202312197990)

2. As of May 2024 "Afghanistan has lost its voting rights in the General Assembly due to unpaid membership dues and failure to provide reasonable explanations for the non-payment" [LINK](https://amu.tv/97702/)

## {background-image="Images/15_2-krain_header.png" background-size='85%'}

::: notes

This week we've been exploring research by Matt Krain (2012).

### What is the research question in the paper?
(Does "naming and shaming" reduce the severity of genocide and politicides?)

<br>

### And what's the difference between genocide and politicide?
(Both are mass killings, one targeting a "communal" group, the other political enemies)
:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

**Interests**

+ Leaders of states care about their reputations and legitimacy
+ NGOs / IOs want less genocide / politicide

**Institutions**

+ Global norm: Genocide / Politicide is not legitimate

**Interactions**, Naming and Shaming (N&S):

+ Exposes the crimes (public not private)
+ Raises the profile of the crimes (global not domestic)
+ May change perpetrators' self-perceptions
+ Activates bystanders
+ Encourages state sanctions
+ May cost the perpetrator state access to aid or trade

::: notes

Here are the interests, institutions and interactions we identified on Wednesday.

### How convincing do you find these mechanisms in terms of their logic?

#### - Are they sufficiently clear?

#### - Do they connect sufficiently to the decision-making of the bad leader?

<br>

### Remind me also, how does this represent a test of the Constructivist model of politics?
1. (The power of discourse!) AND
2. (The importance of identity and your inability to control how others assign that identity to you)

<br>

### Ok, what are the big conclusions raised at the end of this paper?
:::



## Make an Argument {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Based on the data and methods used here do we have high, low or no confidence in each of these conclusions?**

"The results suggest that naming and shaming by...

1. NGOs
2. the Northern media
3. IOs

...all have significant ameliorative effects on the severity of the most extreme atrocities" (14).

::: notes

We'll need to keep in mind that the answers to this question about our confidence may depend on which of the mechanisms we are focused on.

- We may find that the argument about NGOs, the media or IOs is more convincing than the others.

<br>

Let's evaluate the analyses in order to clarify the conclusions and figure out how confident we are in them.

- *Split class into small groups (3-4)*

- Go sit with your group!
:::


## Krain (2012): Cases {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', out.width='80%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/15_3-Table1.png")
```

**Focus on footnote 7 (p578)**

::: notes
Let's start by trying to understand the case selection in the paper.

- Groups, how did Krain select the cases to study? And what does "ongoing" mean in footnote 7?

<br>

*Report Back*

<br>

"Ongoing" means the genocide has begun.

- This is not meant to be a test of whether N&S can prevent a genocide from beginning.

<br>

Also, seems to imply that we are supposed to ignore cases that wrapped up in less than a year.

### What is the effect of eliminating short genocides from the paper? Why do this?

<br>

Makes sense if data analysis is year to year change BUT

- Long genocides likely to invoke many, many different interests and pressures. Hard to isolate a press release, no?

<br>

### Assuming this is the "correct" list, are we confident the Table 1 list presents an equal test of the media, AI and the UNCHR?

- Selection bias possible: Big variation in attention paid by "northern" media to different countries around the world, right?
:::



## Krain (2012): Outcome {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.retina=3, fig.align='center', out.width='92%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/15_3-Table2.png")
```

::: notes

Table 2 summarizes how Krain measures the key outcome variable in this paper

- e.g. the magnitude and severity of a genocide/politicide

<br>

Groups, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of measuring genocide in these 10 levels

- Get ready to report back your findings.

<br>

*Report Back*

<br>

This is the variation the paper aims to explain.

### Let's get it out of the way first, why not just use the actual numbers?
(We simply don't know that precisely.)

- Great uncertainty at the super-specific level

<br>

### Ok, groups, how does the operationalization and measurement of the outcome variable impact your level of confidence in the conclusion?

(Problems identified:)

1. Takes way more killings to move to the highest levels than to move across the low levels. Intervals not consistent.

2. If not per capita (and Pakistan / Indonesia have way bigger populations) than this might not be an equal test across the cases.

- Small number of deaths in a huge vs small state carries different seriousness, no?

<br>

### Do these specific grouping choices make it harder to identify small, but meaningful, effects?
#### - To the disadvantage of one of our actors more than the others?
:::



## Krain (2012): Predictors {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/15_3-key_predictors.png")
```

::: notes

Ok, groups, same question applied to the operationalization and measurement of the key predictor variables.

- Get ready to report back on these five measures

- Do these do a "good" job measuring "naming and shaming"? Why or why not?

<br>

*Report Back*

### Strengths and weaknesses here?

## {background-image="Images/15_3-Appendix.png" background-size='88%'}

::: notes

As we've noted before, the descriptive statistics in the appendix are a useful way to think about how the world looks in this analysis.

### Does everybody remember what the "mean" tells you?

### What about the minimum and maximum?

<br>

### Based on the descriptive statistics, tell me about how the world looks in this sample.

<br>

#### - How brutal is the average abuse? 

#### - How much media coverage? 
- (Super low, .67 articles in a given 12 months)

#### - How many AI reports get released on average? 
- (6.49)

#### - What proportion of cases are targeted by the UNCHR? 
- (55% Politics in all things)

#### - What proportion of cases are during the cold war? 
- (79%)

#### - Tell me about the breakdown of interventions: pro-perpetrator vs anti-perpetrator vs impartial. Does this make sense? 
- (53% Pro perpetrator!)

<br>

### Does this tell us anything about what life is like in most dictatorships? Why or why not?
:::



## {background-image="Images/15_3-regression2.png"}

::: notes

Here are the regression results.

<br>

Don't stress what this represents in statistical terms, but think of it as an attempt to measure the effects while controlling for other important effects.

- e.g. Control for magnitude if you believe that discourse works better or worse for really bad atrocities

- e.g. Control for population if you believe that discourse works better or worse for countries with huge populations

<br>

Key here is that the estimated effect of each form of naming and shaming reduces the severity of ongoing atrocities (on average).

- However, the effect is not significant for AI News Reports

- AND the AI effects in general are super tiny

<br>

**SLIDE**: Tables 5, 6 and 8 give us an easier way to visualize the size of these effects.
:::



## {background-image="Images/15_3-Table5.png" background-size='88%'}

::: notes

Let's examine Table 5 together.

- This focuses on naming and shaming efforts by media.

- The columns represent different levels of media attention: no attention, average attention, 1 SD above average and the maximum level of observed attention.

- The rows represent the number of people killed the next year after this naming and shaming has occurred.

```
:::
::::

::: notes

Let's zoom in here on just the first column.

- These numbers estimate the number of people killed in a state committing human rights violations and receiving no media attention.

- The values are proportions that run from 0 to 1, or 0% to 100%.

- This bar plot helps us visualize the data.

- If you add all these proportions together you get 100%

<br>

### Does everybody understand the numbers in the red box and how those numbers become the bar plot on the side?

<br>

**So, what do we learn from this column of %'s?**

- **In other words, if the media ignores an ongoing genocide / politicide what is the likely number of deaths next year?**

- (Most likely, e.g. the three biggest proportions, is between 8k and 64k deaths!)

- Does everybody see the bulk of this distribution on the medium to high end of the spectrum.

<br>

### So, based on this model of simulated outcomes how serious is any ongoing genocide or politicide likely to be?

- (90% of ignored cases will result in more than 2k dead)

- (75% of ignored cases will see more than 8k killed)

- (Apprx 40% of ignored cases will see more than 32k killed)

### Does that make sense?

<br>

**This model indicates that countries experiencing any degree of genocide or politicide are likely to spiral very rapidly.**
:::



## {background-image="Images/15_3-Table5_news.png" background-size='90%'}

::: notes

**So, what happens when we move from zero media attention to the maximum level observed (12 reports)?**

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.width=9, fig.asp=.45, cache=TRUE}
# Visualize both

  theme_minimal() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1), breaks = seq(0, .6, .2))
```

::: notes

NOTE! I've reversed the y-axis to make this more logical.

- Moving up the y-axis should mean more killings, not less.

<br>

A striking result!
- Increases in the number of media reports pushes the cases to the lower ends of the scale in some sizable ways.

<br>

In the "no news reports" cases, most observations between 8k and 64k killed per year.
- That's an obscene number of deaths.

<br>


Shift to the maximum (12 reports) and now 67% of cases below 300 deaths!
- So many lives apparently saved.

<br>

Now, the minimum to the maximum is probably not the effect we are most interested in.

- It would be hard for an individual or group to convince the entire media to focus on one thing in one way.

<br>

**SLIDE**: However, increasing from one story (the mean) to two stories (mean + 1 sd) might be doable.

Better, right?

Next week we explore feminist IR which can be oversimplified to mean the interaction of gender and international politics.

- Although, as we'll see, it is so much more than that.
:::



## Assignment for Next Class  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Find a current, or recent, international political event that **explicitly deals with issues of gender**

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - The APA citation for your evidence, and
    
    - A short explanation for why this case illustrates a gender issue in international politics

::: notes

Let's think broadly about this

- Find us something that is motivated by gender, or shows an international impact that differs across the genders

- Please avoid overlap, first-come, first-served.

<br>

### Questions on the assignment?
