Prep for Class

1. IN CLASS: Review Canvas submissions AND track which articles claimed to be most problematic (line 237-ish)
    
    - Update slides as needed

2. Bring markers x 4

3. Post link to Google Sheet for claiming countries on Canvas
    - First name, Last name, Country 1 - Dictatorship, Country 2 - Democracy
    - Plus include a list of each beside table (see FA23 version)
    
<br>

Today I want us to analyze the UN's role as a norm entrepreneur in creating and propagating the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

- We're undoubtedbly going to get sidetracked a lot, but let's try to keep our eye on evaluating the norm creation process

<br>

**SLIDE**: Basics on the UN DHR

:::





## {background-image="Images/13_3-Roosevelt.png"}

::: notes

The UDHR was adopted by the UN General Assembly on December 10, 1948.

<br>

**Anybody recognize this person?**

- (Eleanor Roosevelt!)

    - Wife of FDR (president 1933-1945)
    
    - Had an incredible career as a diplomat and activst
    
    - "She served as the first Chairperson of the Commission on Human Rights and played an instrumental role in drafting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights" ([UN Link](https://www.un.org/en/observances/human-rights-day/women-who-shaped-the-universal-declaration)).

<br>

**Had anybody ever read this UN document before?**

- **Anything about what it includes that surprised you? Why or why not?**

<br>

Today I want us to analyze the UN DHR as an attempt by the UN to enshrine new global norms

- **SLIDE**: But first, a quick refresher on Constructivism
:::




## Constructivism {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

+ Actors and structures are mutually constituted

+ Interests and identities are linked and multi-layered

+ Anarchy is an imagined community

+ Power is material AND discursive

+ Change is possible, difficult and a normal part of the process

::: notes

This week we've been exploring Constructivism as an approach to explaining international political events

- **What do we like about this approach to explaining international political events?**

- **What concerns do you have with using this approach to explaining international political events?**

<br>

Last class we explored Finnemore and Sikkink's work on the norm life cycle.

- Today I want us to evaluate the UN DHR using this theoretical map

- Let's make sure we're clear on the three stages

<br>

**What happens in the norm emergence stage?**

- (Norm entrepreneurs actively try to convince their community that some behavior is EITHER:)

    - Desirable and should be required, OR
    
    - Undesirable and should be stopped.

- We can think of Eleanor Roosevelt and the UN General Assembly as doing this work with the DHR

<br>

**What happens in the norm cascade stage?**

- The norm cascade phase is when a norm, having achieved initial support, begins to spread rapidly

- States and organizations adopt it for reasons ranging from:

    - moral conviction,
    
    - reputational benefits, and 
    
    - international pressure 

<br>

**Finally, what is internalization and why is it so powerful?**

- (Internalization: The norm becomes a part of an actor's identity)

- (Powerful: Rules we follow without thinking about it)

    - Once internalized the norm is taken for granted

    - It is now part of how we think and therefore how we act.

    - Very, very hard to dislodge.

<br>

Let's now examine the UN DHR

- *Split class into four groups, mix up the people!*

- Go sit with your groups and grab some board space

<br>

**SLIDE**: The job

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)**
:::

![](Images/13_2-norm_life_cycle.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

Groups, three columns on the board: emergence, cascade, internalized

- Your job is to classify each article in the UN DHR by where it currently sits in this process

- Don't set the stage 3 bar too high!

    - A norm can be internalized even if broken occasionally
    
    - Think about the efforts China and Russia go to in order to justify certain problematic behaviors as consistent with international law

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*Report Back and Discuss*

**SLIDE**: The US case

**Where is the US in this process?**
:::

::: notes

**Would your answers change if I asked you to focus on the US alone?**

- **In other words, is the US further along in this process than the global community? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: US law

:::




## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**The UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)**

- Any conflicts with the US legal system?

:::

- One Vote: Articles 9, 10, 11, 18, 19

- Two Votes: Articles 5, 12, 13, 21

- Three Votes: Articles 28

- More Votes: Articles 14, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 29

::: notes

In Canvas today I asked you to identify which articles struck you as the toughest fit for the US legal system

<br>

Let's hear your reasoning

- **Why are these the toughest fit for the US system?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Overall

**So, where are we in the norm life cycle with the UN's DHR?**

<br>

- **How close do you think we are to a "tipping point" of wide acceptance?**

- **Which rights are furthest away?**

## Assignment for Next Class  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Claim a democracy and a dictatorship (first-come, first-served) and review their current human rights record using:

1. The country reports by the US Department of State
2. The country reports by Amnesty International
3. The country reports by Human Rights Watch

Submit a summary of each country to Canvas before class (2-3 sentences each)

::: notes

Next week we explore the power of publicity to reduce human rights violations.

- To get us ready for that, I want to get you some practice with some of the key pieces of evidence that research draws on.

<br>

Technically I've given you a list of "most" and "least" democratic states in the world according to the V-Dem project's electoral democracy index.

<br>
