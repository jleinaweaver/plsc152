**The Threat from DPRK**
:::

::: notes

Today I'd like us to examine this very scary and very important debate about what should be done as North Korea expands its nuclear arsenal and continues to provoke the world with missile tests.

- I think this also gives us a good opportunity to put the theories we've been exploring to the test.

<br>

**In short, what is Bolton's thesis?**

- (We should bomb NK)

<br>

**And what position do Sagan and Weiner take?**

- (That would be a terrible idea)

<br>

*Split the class in half*

- Group 1, diagram the Bolton argument on the board

- Group 2, diagram the Sagan and Wiener argument on the board

<br>

*Bolton premises (my skim)*

- Only "months" left to act to prevent DPRK acquiring the means to hit the US with a nuke.
- Threat is imminent
- Nukes change our understanding of "necessity"
- Historical analogy: Technology forced expansion of territorial waters (FDR then Reagan) shows reality must change our understanding of self-defense and necessity
- Caroline criteria in international law are a custom and customs should evolve to match state practices
Therefore, we should attack DPRK's nuclear infrastructure.

From wikipedia: The Caroline test is a 19th-century formulation of customary international law, reaffirmed by the Nuremberg Tribunal after World War II, which said that the necessity for preemptive self-defense must be "instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation." The test takes its name from the Caroline affair.

*Sagan and Wiener premises*

- Bolton's logic is flawed and dangerous
- The definition of pre-emption is clear and this ain't it
- This would be a preventive war and those are illegal acts of aggression
- Korean war armistice does not justify new attacks
- President doesn't have the authority to start a war
- Israeli example "illegal but legitimate" doesn't apply here because nuclear retaliation was off the table
- It is too late for this attack to not provoke an "unacceptable retaliation"

Therefore, the US should NOT strike DPRK first.

**Where would you place Bolton's argument in the models we've examined so far? Why?**

**Where would you place Sagan and Weiner's (2018) argument in the models we've examined so far? Why?**

**What are the prescriptions for this problem from the perspective of each model?**

<br>

### - Neorealism?
- (Security dilemmas only end one way...)

### - Offensive Realism?
- (Defense of hegemony demands the US act...)

### - Democratic Peace Theory?
- (Peace treaty and try to engage with NK?)

### - Economic Liberalism?
- (Draw them into the international trade system? e.g. no more sanctions!)

### - Bargaining Model of War?
### - Is there a negotiated outcome possible per the bargaining model?

<br>

### So, where do we end up? Is the threat serious enough for us to break international law?

### - Did anybody change their mind?

## Assignment for Next Class {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Hultman, Kathman & Shannon (2016) on United Nations Peacekeeping (p231-238)

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - What is the research question in this paper?
    
    - What is their proposed answer to the question?

::: notes
Next class we dig into a research paper that explores the effect of the United Nations on war.

- Your job is to read the set-up of the paper (231-238) so we can explore the model they propose to test.
