## Section 2: Why Are There Wars? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- Neorealism

- Offensive Realism

- Liberal Institutionalism

- Economic Liberalism

- Bargaining Model of War

::: notes

Last week we started exploring the established IR answer to the puzzling question, why are there wars?

### What is the Neorealist answer?
- (A: Anarchy -> Fear)

- (Neorealism: States want to survive, war comes from uncertainty and the security dilemma.)

<br>

### What is the Offensive Realist answer?
- (A: Anarchy -> Great powers must pursue regional hegemony)

- (Offensive realism: Powerful states want hegemony and war comes from the pursuit of it!)

<br>

This week we're going to explore two models that fit under the broad label of liberalism.

- This isn't liberal like the term is used in American politics and it's not liberal like economists use it.

- I don't know why this word is used so many different ways, but it certainly keeps us on our toes.

<p style="color: white;">**Liberal Institutionalism**</p>
:::

::: notes

Today we explore one of the biggest implications of many liberal models of international relations.

- The existence, or not, of a democratic peace.

<br>

The fundamental idea here is that the spread of democratic institutions and economic exchange leads us to a more peaceful world.

- Interestingly, this is an argument with very, very old roots.

- Today I want us to explore the roots of this idea and then map out the model itself

<br>

Funnily enough, we're going to do this in reverse order

- **SLIDE**: We'll begin with the mechanisms and then we'll get to the Kant argument

**How Do Institutions Affect Cooperation?**

- Setting standards of behavior

- Verifying compliance

- Reducing the costs of joint decision making

- Resolving disputes
:::

::: notes

The excerpt I gave you from the Frieden, Lake and Schultz text introduces you to a few mechanisms by which institutions can help states cooperate

- In terms of Section 2 of the class this "cooperation" could simply mean avoiding war

- BUT, as the chapter makes clear, this can also create the space for so much more!

<br>

**What example does the chapter give of an institution "setting standards of behavior?**

- ()

**And verifying compliance?**

- ()

**And reducing the costs of joint decision making?**

- ()

**And resolving disputes?**

- ()

<br>

**Any questions on these causal mechanisms?**

- e.g. ways institutions can change state interactions?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Ok, let's take this into the Kant argument!

## Kant (1798): Perpetual Peace {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**The First Definitive Article for Perpetual Peace**

- "The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican"

**The Second Definitive Article for Perpetual Peace**

- "The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States"

**The Third Definitive Article for Perpetual Peace**

- "The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality"

::: notes

**What is Kant's goal in this article?**

- (Help the world achieve perpetual peace)

**And what does "perpetual" peace mean?**

- (Never ending peace, an end to all wars!)

<br>

Kant argues that adopting these three principles will eventually lead us to a world of perpetual peace.

- I think we'd all agree that everlasting peace is a nice goal.

<br>

The question is, how close does Kant get us to achieving that goal?

- Let's dig into both sides on each of these.

<br>

*Split class into three groups and assign one article to each*

- Go sit with your groups and claim some space on the board!

Groups, you have 10 minutes to prepare an answer to this question: 

- Would the global adoption of this article advance the cause of global peace?

- You have to work directly on the board to make two lists: Pros vs Cons

2. Why might it work? (connect to FLS ch2)

3. Why might it fail?

::: notes

Ok, Group 1, you're up!

- Start us off with the broad strokes before we get into your analyses.

- **Define the article for us. What does a "Republican" constitution require?**

<br>

Kant is arguing ONLY about the preferred "form of government" NOT who holds the sovereign power

- Per Kant, a republican constitution is "established ... by principles of":

    1. Freedom: "...the freedom of the members of a society (as men)"
    
    2. The rule of law: "...dependence of all upon a single common legislation (as subjects)"
    
    3. Equality: "by the law of their equality (as citizens)"
    
<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's illustrate this distinction in two dimensions

:::

  labs(title = "Typology of Governments: Dimension 1",
       subtitle = "Who 'possesses the sovereign power'?")
```

::: notes

Per Kant, all governments in the world can be arrayed along this first dimension

- The question is, what persons "possesses the sovereign power?"

<br>

On the extreme left are systems where all supreme authority is invested in one person for the benefit of that person

- e.g. dictatorships

<br>

The middle are the systems where all supreme authority is invested in a few persons/groups or to the benefit of only a few persons/groups

- e.g. aristocracies and other forms of oligarchy

<br>

On the other extreme is a system in which supreme authority belongs to everyone and the state exists to benefit everyone

- e.g. a democracy!

<br>

**Where would you put the US on this dimension? Why?**

  labs(title = "Typology of Governments: Dimension 2",
       subtitle = "How 'does the state use its power'?")
```

::: notes

Per Kant, all governments in the world can also be arrayed along this second dimension

- The question is, what is the form of government? 

- Put differently, how "does the state use its power?"

<br>

On one end the government is empowered to make AND enforce all of the rules in society

- e.g. despotism

<br>

On the other end, the institutions that make the laws are separated from those that enforce the laws

- e.g. republicanism

<br>

**Everybody clear on this Dimension?**

**Where would you put the US on this dimension? Why?**

::: notes

**Has anyone heard the argument that America is a republic and not a democracy?**

- **How does Kant's typology, e.g. two dimensions of government variation, help us evaluate that claim?**

<br>

Unfortunately, given this is an incredibly common argument, it is based on:

1. A fundamental misunderstanding of what these words mean, and 

2. A fundamental misunderstanding of the ways we describe variation in the form and function of government

<br>

**Big picture 1:** Democracy and republic are not the opposite ends of a single  spectrum, they are two different ways of describing the variation in a system

- Governments vary BOTH in how democratic they are AND how republican

- Governments can exist in any of the four quadrants

- e.g. democratic republics AND despotic republics

- So, an argument presenting republic and democracy as opposites is a misunderstanding or a lie
    
<br>

**Big picture 2:** IFF we take the argument at face value, then an argument that we are a republic but not a democracy is an argument that we were designed by the founding fathers to be an oligarchy or a dictatorship

- That strikes me as very hard to support as an argument given our founding documents and history

- Also, I think most Americans would object strongly to that idea

<br>

**Everybody clear on this?**

- **Was this a helpful breakdown?**

<br>

Let's use this typology to talk about current events just for a second

- **SLIDE**: I think this visualization helps to illustrate why so many academics are incredibly worried right now

```

::: notes

Much of American history can be plotted on this typology

<br>

We were founded as a constitutional republic but with some seriously shaky democratic foundations

- e.g. the electoral college, appointment of senators, and much more

<br>

Over time we have struggled to become more democratic (expand who is included in the sovereign "people")

- Abolished slavery in the 1860s
    
- Moved to using "secret" ballot voting in the 1880s and 1890s
    
- Giving women the right to vote in the 1920s
    
- Guaranteeing African-Americans the right to vote in the 1960s
    
<br>

This progress slowed after 9/11 with the spread of rules meant to police voting more strictly and regarding the treatment of religious minorities

- **SLIDE**: Today...

::: notes

What we are currently experiencing is less an attack on democracy and more an attack on our republic

<br>

So far the rhetoric of the government has not been to threaten the concept of popular sovereignty (e.g. the state belongs to the people)

- The actions of the current government have been to claim both the law-making and enforcement powers for itself

- By Kant's definition that IS despotism

<br>

Classifying our current status is not so cut and dried

- However, the evidence is accumulating quite rapidly that this is what is happening currently

- America today is leaving behind its republican roots

<br>

The danger is that despotic democracies don't tend to be stable equliibria

- **SLIDE**: Meaning they tend to be transition states between regime types

::: notes
    
The danger we see as political scientists is knowing that despotism almost always comes for democracy

- You know the old saw, "power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely"?

<br>

Once a government has all the power, they tend to come to see that maximizing their gains is easiest by restricting democracy

- Why gamble with your control over government in something like a free and fair election?

- Especially when it is SO easy to slant the odds in your favor

<br>

If we're willing to put in the work we can reclaim our republic!

<br>

I want to be VERY clear: None of this is a critique of the policy aims of the current government

- I am not arguing for or against shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy

- I am not arguing for or against closing down agencies like the Department of Education or USAID

<br>

I am using Kant to show you that **HOW** the government does these things matters!

- The Republicans control Congress and the presidency, so there is NO reason they cannot pass a law doing all of these things

- Government should enforce the laws and Congress should make them

- THAT is how we protect our freedom

- For those of us who care about our republic, we must demand they return to the law

**What are the pros and cons of adopting this article to achieve world peace?**

#### (PRO:)
1. Organized well to meet threats; unity; 
2. Separation of powers tames the ambitions of selfish and aggressive individuals.; 
3. Consent of the people to war is hard to win because they themselves must pay the costs of war themselves.;

5. (Doyle's idea) Regular rotation of office prevents personal animosities between heads of state from escalating across time.

1. At best, creates "caution" not "peace."; 
2. "organized well" can lead to constant preparation for war that can enhance military institutions to the point they take over a society

Ok, Group 2, you're up!

- Start us off with the broad strokes before we get into your analyses.

### What is a "Federation of Free States"? What does that require?

#### (PRO:)
1. Cooperation begets cooperation;
2. "League" not a "treaty" ends all wars not just one without imposing new civil laws on the powers of a state, just maintains peace between them
3. NOT a world state, that is tyranny
4. Demonstrated success will lead other states to join, widening the league
5. Encourage diplomacy

#### (Con:)
1. Liberalism is not inherently peace-loving; free states will not necessarily be restrained or act in pursuit of peace
2. Liberal states may, in fact, be more aggressive toward nonliberal states.

2. Why might it work? (connect to FLS ch2)

Ok, Group 3, you're up!

- Start us off with the broad strokes before we get into your analyses.

### What is "Universal Hospitality"? What does that require?

<br>

#### (PRO:)
1. More interactions, more communication should equal greater levels of peacefulness and comity.
2. NOT a right to settle or plunder, more about allowing voluntary exchanges of goods and ideas

#### (Con:)
1. How does universal hospitality not create powerful identity crises?
2. Voiceless minority in each country (no say in government as a long-term visitor) is approaching despotism for that government, right?

<br>

Generally speaking, Doyle seems enthusiastic when reframing the third article to be more about cosmopolitan law.

### What is cosmpolitan law and why is he enthusiastic about its capacity to foster peace?

(Every state embracing a "spirit of commerce" adds material incentives to the need to avoid war.)

- Trade means the greatest benefit comes from working together
- States no longer have to meddle in production and distribution questions, leave it to the businesses!

Institutions: 

- Accept the Realist baseline (anarchy), BUT

- Argue that states have worked hard to infringe on the anarchy by creating international institutions (e.g. the UN, ICJ, ICC, IMF, World Bank, and on and on...)

- This is the evolution of Kant's desire for a "federation of free states". A layer on top of anarchy.

### And what are the key interactions that alter state decision-making?

- International institutions can help to overcome cooperation dilemmas, reduce uncertainty, and distribute benefits

::: notes

Interactions: 

- Institutional rules change the dynamics of decision-making by states in important ways (see Keohane)
    - Reducing transaction costs
    - Providing information
    - Making commitments more credible
    - Establishing focal points for coordination
    - Facilitating the principle of reciprocity
    - Extending the shadow of the future
    - Enabling interlinkages of issues, which raises the cost of noncompliance

- The Federation and the principal of universal hospitality lead to a place wherein our institutions can HOPEFULLY overcome anarchy's impulse to war.

### Questions on this model?

### Questions on how this model answers our question about "why wars"?

- Same general sources as Realists, but war is also a failure of the institutions we have created!

## Kant's Preliminary Articles {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

1. No secret treaty of peace shall be held valid in which there is tacitly reserved matter for a future war

2. No independent states, large or small, shall come under the dominion of another state by inheritance, exchange, purchase, or donation

3. Standing armies shall in time be totally abolished

4. National debts shall not be contracted with a view to the external friction of states

5. No state shall by force interfere with the constitution or government of another state

6. No state shall, during war, permit such acts of hostility which would make mutual confidence in the subsequent peace impossible: such are the employment of assassins (percussores), poisoners (venefici), breach of capitulation, and incitement to treason (perduellio) in the opposing state

::: notes

So, here's the deal, in Kant's full essay he proposes six preliminary articles that must be adopted in order for his main three articles to achieve peace.

### Do you think adding these preliminary articles make the plan stronger or weaker? Why?

<br>

### Which would be the easiest ones to implement? Why?

<br>

### Which would be the hardest to implement? Why?

<br>

*Notes on Each*
1. No reservations or agreements to decide contentious issues later. Settle everything now.
2. A state is not property, it is a society of men who no one outside their state has a right to command or dispose of.
3. Also applies to bulding up of massive treasuries, building up these resources is a threat to others.
4. Trade built on credit systems (blames England explicitly) leads to amassing treasure and seeking war
5. However, you can jump in and pick sides in a civil war. For some reason that's not a problem.
