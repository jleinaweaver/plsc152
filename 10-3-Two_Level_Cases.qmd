Ok, talk me through Putnam's two-level game model of international relations.

- **What are the key elements? What is this model?**

<br>

- Explaining international political events as a two-level game

    - Level I: The international negotiation between leaders (or their representatives).
    
    - Level II: The leader's negotiation with constituents to accept their international deal.

- The key is that these levels interact!
    
    - International negotiations impact domestic politics, AND
    
    - Domestic politics changes international negotiations
    
- Win-set sizes matter!

    - Level I Win-Sets: The range of outcomes the leader would accept in the international bargain.
    
    - Level II Win-Sets: The range of outcomes that could be ratified by domestic institutions.
    
    - larger win-sets make Level I agreement more likely
    
    - leaders benefit from having small Level II win-sets

<br>

**SLIDE**: To your cases!

## Assignment for Today  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Find us a real world case illustrating at least some of the dynamics of Putnam's Two-Level Game (e.g. domestic politics complicating international bargaining or vice versa).

1. Submit APA citation,
2. Explain what happened, and 
3. Explain how it is an example of two-level game dynamics

::: notes

So, how do we use the win-sets and the two levels to explain and better understand international political events?

- Let's use your cases today to answer that question!

<br>

To start, everybody review the cases submitted today on Canvas

1. Are the citations correctly in APA format?

2. Are the descriptions clear enough for you to understand? Ask for clarifications if you need them!

<br>

*Split class into four groups (6 people each) and have groups claim board space*

- Go sit with your group!

### Therefore, useful explanations of international political events should always include domestic politics.

::: notes

Groups, your job will be to reflect on our work in class and the cases submitted to Canvas in order to make this argument

- To be clear, NONE of the classic IR theories we have studied this semester support this conclusion!

- But that doesn't mean it is wrong!

<br>

**Questions?**

- Get to work! Work directly on the board!

<br>

*Next step: Build class consensus diagram by taking best of the options*

<br>

**How convincing do you find this argument? Why or why not?**

- **Are there any serious counterarguments we need to consider?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Time to diagram the model!

- Constituents want specific policies or goods

**Institutions:**

- International negotiations require leaders to agree a policy (Level I)
- Domestic negotiations require leaders to get approval from constituents (Level II)

**Interactions:**

- Win-set size matters
    - Larger Level I = more likely agreement
    - Smaller Level II = more influential leader
- Leaders should strategically try to influence win-set sizes home and abroad

::: notes

Bottom line: Therefore, domestic politics complicates all international bargaining

<br>

### What kinds of situations / outcomes can we use this model to explain?

- (BIG: Two-level game can be applied to more situations and not just a shared resource)
- (More useful than a pure PD game which focuses on resource division/use)

<br>

### Questions on this model?

::: notes

The US and South Korea typically run huge joint military exercises each year

- As an international interaction this makes sense, e.g. two allies demonstrating the strength of their alliance to an international enemy

<br>

HOWEVER, this also serves important domestic constituencies for each country!

- The US 


- As close allies this is a chance to ensure seamless operation between them, and for us to show off the military tech we have for sale!

<br>

Needless to say given this headline, these drills also tend to threaten the stability of Kim Jong Un's regime in North Korea

- These drills are BIG and they are far too close to the DPRK for Kim Jong Un's comfort

- **SLIDE**: Therefore, these tend to be moments when the North's military figures get antsy, so...
