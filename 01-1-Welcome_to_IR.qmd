Prep for Class

1. Update attendance list before class

2. Make sure this week's modules visible in Canvas

3. Log into Canvas on classroom PC

<br>

*As students come in*

Welcome all.

- Sit down, introduce yourself to the people around you and get chatting about my prompt on the board.

- Build two lists as a group!

<br>

*ON BOARD*

### Ok, what is on your lists?

- SHARE and DISCUSS

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's make sure we're all in the right place!
:::


## Introductions {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"  .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Name

2. Year in school

3. Major

4. "Important" international events are...

:::

::: notes

My aim with this last one is to get a sense for how the class thinks about "importance" on the world stage

- In other words, what kinds of events should we be paying attention to? Why?

<br>

1. Name: I'm Dr. Leinaweaver.

2. Year in school: 13th year at Drury

3. Major: Political scientist with primary research interests in international policy-making and problem-solving

4. **Let's see what you guys think!**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Back to the board!
:::


## On balance, has the US been a net positive or negative influence on the world over the last 10 years? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: notes

All of this adds up to a big, tough to handle question.

- I don't want to pretend our lists on the board are comprehensive or that this question isn't crazy reductive.

<br>

However, I'd like to take this opportunity to get a sense of how our class thinks about the role of the US in the world BEFORE we start our work this semester.

### So, what do you think?

::: notes

Welcome to International Relations (IR).

<br>

Our job this semester is to analyze "politics" happening at the international level.

- What does that mean? We'll get there!

<br>

Today's Agenda: Set up our class and plan for the semester
:::


## Learning Outcomes {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"  .center}

<br>

### Explaining international political events like an IR scholar requires learning...

::: {.r-fit-text}
::: {.incremental}
- LO 1: The big ideas and basic definitions of the field

- LO 2 & 3: To use the tools of social scientists

- LO 4: To write convincing arguments
:::
:::

::: notes

Big picture, we have four learning outcomes this semester.

- All four are in the syllabus, but let me simplify them for you.

<br>

1. Content Knowledge
    - Learn the big ideas and basic definitions you need to explain international political events.

2. Methods Knowledge
    - Learn to use the tools of social scientists for analyzing international political events.

3. Critical Thinking & Problem Solving Skills
    - Practice applying social science tools to solve big problems and answer important questions.

4. Communication Skills
    - Practice writing logical, clear, credible and critical arguments so good that they will convince smart people you are right!

<br>

### Everybody good with these?

<br>

**SLIDE**: To make progress on these LOs I've divided the semester into four sections.

:::



## Semester Outline: Section 1 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Arguments, Evidence and International Relations**

- Making logical arguments,

- Testing those arguments scientifically, and

- Learning to think in terms of models

:::

::: notes

Section 1 sets us up for the semester.

- Here we learn the basic structure we will use for making and evaluating arguments in this class

<br>

This means learning to study politics "scientifically"

- Which is a whole other can of worms...

<br>

Once this is done we can start digging into the BIG questions that inspired the creation of international relations

- **SLIDE**: Such as...

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-Putin.jpg"}

::: notes

**Anybody recognize this fella?**

- (President of Russia Vladimir Putin)

<br>

**And why has old Vladdy been in the news so much over the last few years?**

- (SLIDE: Dude just will not stop invading Ukraine!)

:::



## Semester Outline: Section 2 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Why Are There Wars?**

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('Images/05_2-putin_ukraine.jpg')
```

::: notes

In Section 2 of our we explore the grand-daddy of all IR research questions.

- Why Are There Wars?

<br>

**From what you've heard, why did Russia invade Ukraine?**

*ON BOARD*

- Power? 
- Personality? 
- Territory/Resources? 
- Threats from Alliances?

<br>

**Is this a "good" list if our aim is to be able to explain where wars are likely to start in the future?**

- **In other words, would knowing just these things about a random country help you predict the likelihood of war? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's kick off our next question with another old dude!

:::




## {background-image="Images/01_1-Khamenei.png"}

::: notes

**Anybody recognize this kindly looking fella? Or the flag behind him?**

- (Supreme Leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei)

<br>

**SLIDE**

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-Kahmeni_khomeni.jpg"}

::: notes

To be clear, this on the left is Ali Khamenei, the current Supreme Leader of Iran

- Not to be confused with his predecessor Ruhollah Khomeini, the former supreme leader...

- Not confusing at all.

<br>

**And what are some of the MANY reasons this guy, and his country, have been in the news over the last few years?**

- Nuclear weapons program / nuclear enrichment

- Providing aid and weapons to terror groups like Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthi fighters in Yemen

- Suppressing pro-democracy protests at home

- Launching missile/drone attacks against Israel

- Supporting groups that target American bases and troops in Iraq

- and on and on and on...

<br>

SLIDE: militia support, houthi support, nuke program

:::

::: notes

Iran has definitely been an active participant in Middle East politics for a long time, and to the extreme annoyance of many of its neighbors!

- REVEAL: Offering support in terms of money, arms and expertise to militias throughout the region

- REVEAL: The houthis in Yemen have used Iranian support to destabilize global trade using missile strikes against shipping in the Red Sea

- REVEAL: And, of course, their threatened nuclear program!

<br>

**From what you've heard, why is Iran working so hard to destabilize the Middle East?**

- **Why won't they simply "play nice" with their neighbors?**

<br>

*ON BOARD*

- Pushing back against the US-led order?

- Asserting their own domestic security?

- Supporting their allies in the region / those with a similar view to their own?

- Power projection?

- Technological advancement?

<br>

**If you were the President of the US, what would you do to get Iran to act differently?**

<br>

**Setting aside threats and violence, what would you be willing to offer Iran to change its behavior? Anything?**

## Semester Outline: Section 3 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
Why is it so Hard to Cooperate With Other Countries?
:::

::: notes

In Section 3 of the class we ask why is it so Hard to Cooperate with Other Countries?

<br>

Most countries would prefer to live in a world where Iran stops doing all this destabilizing stuff, but for so many reasons it's hard to get to that world!

- We have a good start here to mapping out the challenges of cooperation when the stakes are so high!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Last photo quiz!

## {background-image="Images/01_1-Yalta-Conference.jpg"}

::: notes

**Who are these three gentlemen and what are we looking at here?**

- Churchill, FDR and Stalin at the Yalta Conference

- The Yalta Conference held in 1945 in Crimea is where the winning powers of WW2 got together to plan the future of Europe.

<br>

Clearly the world has changed a lot since 1945.

- For one thing, we now have color photographs!

<br>

**How much has the world changed since 1945?**

- **What are the biggest differences between today and 1945?**

## Semester Outline: Section 4 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
What is the Future of Transnational Politics and IR?
:::

::: notes

Here's the thing, most of the world's international infrastructure was designed at the end of WWII

- The United Nations was designed to maintain peace 

- The International Court of Justice was designed to help countries settle disputes without fighting

- The World Bank was designed to reduce poverty and promote long-term economic development

- The International Monetary Fund was designed to do a bunch of stuff related to promoting trade and growth

<br>

Basically all of these, and more, were founded in around 1944/1945

<br>

In Section 4 of the class I want us to ask if 80 years later these institutions are still adapted well to the complexities of today

- If not, what do we do about it?

:::



## Semester Outline {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Arguments, Evidence and International Relations

2. Why Are There Wars?

3. Why is it so Hard to Cooperate With Other Countries?

4. What is the Future of Transnational Politics and IR?
:::

::: notes

Alright, so that's our plan for the semester.

### Questions on this?

:::



## {background-image="Images/01_1-newspapers.jpg"}

::: notes

We will kick off most classes with current events discussions.

- This REQUIRES you to follow global news!

<br>

**Part of your job in this class is to keep up with international current events!**

- Skim the international section of a good news site everyday.

- Let's make sure we always have current events we can draw on in our discussions!
:::



## All Supporting Material is on Canvas  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"  .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Canvas_Homepage.png")
```

::: notes
Everybody log into Canvas with me and let's get oriented in our class infrastructure!

<br>

*Log into Canvas, set to student view and step them through the main pages*

- Home page,

- Grades,

- Assignments,

- Modules (with readings and assignment for Thursday)
:::



## The answer is in the syllabus  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/01_1-Course_Syllabus.png")
```

::: notes

Everybody open the syllabus and let's hit the highlights!

- *Give them time to do this*

<br>

1. **Any questions about the LOs or components of your grade?**

2. **Any questions about the attendance policy?**
    
    - Attendance cliff (> 3 unexcused absences = Grade cap of 'C')
    
    - YOU are required to contact me by email for excused absences
    
    - Coach emails alone DO NOT COUNT

3. **Any questions about the participation points?**

    - MOST classes have short pre-class assignments that must be submitted to Canvas
    
    - Other ways to lose participation: Lateness, distracting classmates

4. **Any questions about the Submission Requirements for the Argument Papers?**

<br>

The Modules page of our Canvas site is where I will provide all of the readings and links to the daily assignments.

- **Any question on the Modules page?**

<br>

Bottom line, please keep me in the loop this semester!

- I genuinely want you to make progress on our learning outcomes

- So, if things are getting rough for you please come talk to me.

- I will always offer you flexibility in the face of struggle IF YOU COME TO ME BEFORE DEADLINES HAVE PASSED!

<br>

**Questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: AI policy

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

![](Images/01_1-No_AI_Tools.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

You may not use any AI tools in this class. Any AI use will be treated as plagiarism.

<br>

That means: 

- No AI search

- No AI summaries of articles or books

- No AI for outlining or writing

- No AI for data analysis

- No AI to simply clean up your grammar (e.g. Grammarly).

<br>

Think of this class like training to play a sport

- The time you spend in the gym getting stronger and more flexible makes you a better athlete regardless of the sport you end up playing. 

- That's what we're doing in this class when we learn to critically analyze texts and become better writers.

- I'm getting you ready to succeed out in the real world

- Using AI tools is like bringing a forklift into the weight room. Yeah, you lifted the weights, but it was a waste of your time.

<br>

Other key point: Lots of people are worried about AI taking their jobs, e.g. replacing them in the workforce. 

- If you use AI to do your thinking for you then you are literally replacing yourself with AI

- You are setting yourself up with skills that are basically without value

<br>

So, let's not waste this opportunity working together this semester

- Let's get stronger and be better adapted to whatever the world looks like when you graduate

<br>

**Questions on this policy?**

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

### Check the syllabus and Modules page for the readings and the discussion assignment.


::: notes
Readings and an assignment for next class

1. The readings: I am giving you the Labossiere reading on logical arguments and two op-eds for us to unpack

2. The pre-class assignment: I have found that requiring these pre-class questions sets us up for much livelier engagement in class!

    - Plus makes tracking participation points easier!

<br>

**Questions on what I'm asking you to do?**

- NOTE: The forum closes BEFORE class starts (9:59 am) so make sure to get these in!

<br>

Welcome to the class and let me know if you have any questions!
