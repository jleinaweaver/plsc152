Select a **NEW** international political event and make an argument that one of the IR theories / models we’ve studied in class this term “best” explains the event. 

- Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

- No double-dipping on realism/liberalism

- At least one theory from the second half of class

- No events used in the prior paper

## For Today {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Find a NEW international political event you want to focus on for the final paper

1. Submit TWO pieces of evidence that each provide the basic details of the event (APA format)

2. Explain the event you have chosen (2+ sentences)

3. Make an argument this is an "international political event" (2+ sentences) 


::: notes

Our aim for today is to make sure everyone has an international political event picked out and ready to analyze in the paper.

<br>

*Split class into groups of three*

- Go sit with your group!
:::



## Present Each Event {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Is this an international political event?

2. Is the evidence high enough quality?

:::

::: notes

SMALL GROUPS: Discuss each case and give the presenter feedback on these two points.

<br>

### Questions?

- Get to it!

<br>

Alright, let's hear all the cases you've picked!

## Assignment for Next Class  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

### Check the Modules page for the assignment prompt

::: notes

Canvas: Paper 3 - Applying Models (8 pts)

1. Break your event down into its key components and describe each:
    - Who is the actor?
    
    - What is the action they performed that you are explaining?

2. Briefly explain the event using THREE of the theories from class (note the assignment prompt for theory selection). 
    - Each explanation must be a minimum of three sentences each. 
    - Three theories x three sentences = minimum of nine sentences.

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

With the time remaining today everyone needs to select their three theories!

- Use each other as resources, bounce ideas around!

- Go!
