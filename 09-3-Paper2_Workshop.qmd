## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

Make an argument that one of the IR theories / models we've studied in class so far this term is **the most useful explanation of the event you explored in Paper 1**. 

- Options: Neorealism, Offensive Realism, Liberal Institutionalism, Economic Liberalism, and the Bargaining Model of War

Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

- Your counter-argument may not be from the same paradigm as the main argument
