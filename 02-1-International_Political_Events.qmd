Prep for Class

1. Grade Canvas submissions

2. Bring markers x 5

<br>

This week we've been laying our foundations for the rest of the semester.

- Before we can really dig into explaining international politics, we need to get on the same page about what we are studying

- Today we focus on defining the key outcome IR tries to explain: international political events.

::: notes

For today, I sent out a group of highly motivated researchers to collect international politics case studies for us to examine.

### Has everybody submitted their case on Canvas?

<br>

Let's quickly zip around the room so you can introduce us to your chosen cases.

- In just a sentence or two tell us what you picked and why

- *Don't fill in details or generalize, just let them present!*

Ok, now let's review our citations.

- This is the format you have to use on the papers you will submit in this class so we need to get up to speed on this.

- On this slide I've given you the Purdue OWL formatting instructions for various kinds of web sources.

- Everybody take a minute to review the APA citations in the discussion forum and let us know if any need to be revised.

### Any need fixing?

<br>

*Split class into groups of 5*

- Go sit with your groups!

## Defining the Key Terms {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- International

<br>

- Political

<br>

- Event

::: notes

Ok groups, your job today is to use the examples collected by the class to define these three key concepts.

<br>

In 10 minutes I want each group to write their three definitions on the board.

- Complete sentences, be specific!

<br>

### Questions?

- Get to it!

<br>

*Share definitions, discuss and consolidate*

## Defining the Key Terms {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- International: With a global impact or involving more than one state

<br>

- Political: ...?

<br>

- Event: A thing or happening

::: notes

Here's one version we might consider that sort of holds off on the "politics" definition.

<br>

### Does every case we collected meet these definitions? Why or why not?

<br>

### Within our cases, do any sub-groupings stand out?

### - Cases that are similar in other important ways?
