Prep for Class

1. Check submissions on Canvas
    - Review and give feedback during class
    
<br>

REFLECTIONS SP24

- This went GREAT today with a couple tweaks
- Class focused most of their time in only one pairing
- You made them work for 15 minutes on ONLY the first paper. Force them to push through and keep working on one paper. Make sure the person has a counter for every premise! THEN swap.

- What is the question?
- Why do we care about the question?
- Thesis statement

**Reason 1 (premise)**

- Evidence x 2

**Reason 2 (premise)**

- Evidence x 2

**Reason 3 (premise)**

- Evidence x 2

**Everybody ready to go with this?**

- **Outline in hand?**

<br>

Ok, time to get some feedback!

- Today you will get feedback from two people and have a chance to revise your outline to reflect that feedback.

- In a moment I'll split you into pairs...

<br>

**SLIDE**: Plan of attack!

## Review the Outlines in Pairs {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

**Person 1: Present your Outline**

- What is the question? 

- Why do we care about the question?

- Thesis

- Each premise with evidence

:::

::: notes

Person 1: Present the outline of your paper

- Each item should be a complete sentence
    - or two for the why do we care question

- Each premise should be stated and then supported by evidence

## Review the Outlines in Pairs {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Person 1: Present your Outline**

- What is the question? 
- Why do we care?
- Thesis
- Each premise with evidence

**Person 2: To be convincing to you...**

- Is each item clear?
- Is each premise logical?
- Is each piece of evidence high enough quality?

::: notes
Person 2 gives feedback focused on helping person 1 make it more convincing

- Is each item clear?
    - e.g. Does the sentence convey the idea in a simple and accessible way?

- Is each premise logical?
    - e.g. does it directly support the conclusion?

- Is each piece of evidence high enough quality?

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

**SLIDE**: I also want you to do one more thing!

## Review the Outlines in Pairs {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Person 1: Present your Outline**

- What is the question? 
- Why do we care?
- Thesis
- Each premise with evidence

**Person 2: To be convincing to you...**

- Is each item clear?
- Is each premise logical?
- Is each piece of evidence high enough quality?
- **Identify a counter-argument for each premise**

::: notes

Let's talk about that counter-argument piece (which is new!)

- Per the rubric, a convincing argument paper MUST include critical analysis!

<br>

Critical Analysis can be added to a paper with:

1. A counter-argument
    - Author X (2020) argues that... However, ...
    - To be convincing it MUST always be the STRONGEST version of their argument
    - No straw men! No "Some people argue"...
    
2. Discussions of the limitations of your evidence
    - All measurement is done with error
    - You can boost the depth of your argument by acknowledging how your evidence might be lacking, but making clear why that doesn't mess up your argument
    
<br>

For today, I want you to help each other brainstorm a counter-argument for each premise

- e.g. Here's why my argument might be wrong! And here's how I've addressed those concerns!

- In the actual paper, you'll need to be able to cite evidence for the counter-arguments, but for today we can just generate them

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

*FOR YOU, SAVE TIME TO DO THIS EXERCISE 2x*

## Revise your Outline {background-image="Images/background-blue_triangles2.png" .center}

<br>

**Intro**

**Premise 1** (with evidence)

**Premise 2** (with evidence)

**Premise 3** (with evidence)

**Counter-Argument**

**Conclusion**

::: notes

Now that you've heard some more arguments and gotten feedback on yours it's time to revise.

<br>

Reflect on the feedback, revise your outline and start writing!

- Tighten up those premises

- Add a counter-argument paragraph

<br>

Paper is due at the end of next week!
