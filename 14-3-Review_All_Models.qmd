Prep for Class

1. ...

<br>

Alright everybody, from here on out we shift our focus to your final papers for the semester!

<br>

**SLIDE**: The final paper prompt
:::



## Final Exam (Due May 8, 10am) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Select a **NEW** international political event and make an argument that one of the IR theories / models we’ve studied in class this term “best” explains the event. 

- Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

::: notes

You all did such a good job on the second papers that we're going to run this classic back again!

- Now that you've done this exercise once I'm excited to see how well you do it this time!

<br>

**SLIDE**: A couple of tweaks to the assignment this time
:::



## Final Paper Tweaks {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. You may not select more than one of the realist or liberal theories 

    - Either neorealism or offensive realism, not both

    - Either economic liberalism or liberal institutionalism, not both

::: notes

You don't have to select any of these four theories, but if you do you can't double-dip in the same waters.

<br>

### Make sense?

## Final Paper Tweaks {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

2) You must select at least one of the theories from the second half of the class

    - e.g. Prisoner's Dilemma, Two-Level Bargaining, Constructivism, Feminist Theory, Postcolonial Theory

3) You **may not** select one of the topics explored in anyone's second paper:
:::

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Belarus and Russia nuke deal
- China vs Philippines in South China Sea
- Colombia vs the ELN
- Israel bombing Syrian weapons depots
- Israel-Gaza ceasefire
- NATO spending in Europe
- Niger, Mali, and Burkina Faso withdraw from ECOWAS
- Russia and DPRK alliance
- Syrian civil war
- The severing of Baltic Sea cables / attack on NATO
- Trump revoking executive order 14115

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- Trump tariff threats against Colombia
- Tuareg vs Mali government
- Turkey attack on Kurdish forces in Syria
- US deportation flights to Colombia
- US deportation flights to Mexico
- US leaves the WHO
- US leaving Paris Agreement
- US prisoner exchange with Taliban
- US sanctions on Russia
- US supplies weapons to Ukraine
- US suspends all foreign aid / USAID
:::
::::


::: notes

That's it, those are the tweaks.

<br>

The key for this part is that I need everyone to choose a MUCH more precise event.

- Actor X did action Y to country or international group Z on a specific date

<br>

The international section of every newspaper will give you a list of specific events to explain

<br>

### Any questions on the final paper assignment?

## IR Theories Explored this Semester {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
- Realisms: Neorealism, Offensive Realism
- Liberalisms: Liberal Institutionalism, Economic Liberalism
- Bargaining Model of War
- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Two-Level Bargaining
- Constructivism
- Feminist Theory
- Postcolonial Theory
:::

::: notes

We have explored a number of IR models this semester.

- My hope is that you now have a wide array of tools in your toolbox!

<br>

All of these theories represent simplifications of reality

- e.g. they are not true or false, but hopefully are useful for explanation and prediction

::: notes

In week 7 we reviewed the diagrams for these first five models.

### - Any questions on them?

<br>

The first five models we explored each attack the problem of explaining international political events in broadly the same way

- States are the primary actors in the system and the rules and interactions that matter are interpreted from the state's perspective

- Other actors might exist in the system, but the main focus of these models is on how the interests, institutions and interactions inform the state's actions.

- **Prisoner's Dilemma**
- **Two-Level Bargaining**
- **Constructivism**
- **Feminist Theory**
- **Postcolonial Theory**
:::

::: notes

These second five are somewhat different in their designs and approaches.

- States still matter, but these models argue that researchers who want to explain international political events must stop relying on "the state" as the only important reference point.

- These models focus on important causal mechanisms operating across states and within them.

- These models challenge us to broaden our perspectives on who matters, what they want and how that drives outcomes at the international level

<br>

Let's work today on making sure everyone feels comfortable using these five models to explain international political events

<br>

*Split class into 5 groups*

- Go sit with your group, claim some space on the board!

## Diagramming the Models {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}
1. Prisoner's Dilemma (Axelrod & Hamilton 1981*)

2. Two-Level Bargaining (Putnam 1988)

3. Constructivism (Hopf 1998)

4. Feminist Theory (Enloe 2014)

5. Postcolonial Theory (Vucetic & Persaud 2018)

**This model explains international political events by emphasizing...**

- Interests?

- Institutions?

- Interactions?
:::
::::

::: notes

*There isn't really a widely accepted cite for PD. This is the first big article to push the concept into IR.

<br>

*Assign each model to a group*

<br>

Groups get your diagram of this model up on the board

- Each model tells us how we should explain international political events

- Your job is to get those elements on the board as clearly as you can

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

- *Push them to add to each other's diagrams and keep working to clarify the elements*

<br>

#### Notes

Prisoner's Dilemma

- **The nature of some institutions/interactions leads actors to choose sub-optimal outcomes, even if they really don't want to!**
- Interests: Rational actors pursuing positive return
- Institutions: 1) Uncertainty is high (unknown time horizons, simultaneous decision-making); 2) Available resource is non-excludable (anyone can access it); 3) Biggest rewards for short-term defection OR long-term cooperation
- Interactions: Rivalrous resource (Your use changes reward to other side)
- Expectations: Therefore, best outcome is sustained cooperation but too risky so defection the dominant strategy

Two-Level Bargaining

- **Domestic politics is vital for understanding international outcomes!**
- Interests: Leaders want political survival AND Constituents want specific policies
- Institutions: Level I (International): Leader vs Leader for policy; Level II (Domestic): Leader vs Constituents for ratification/survival
- Interactions: 1) Moves made on the Level I game board shift the pieces on Level II (and vice versa); 2) Larger Level I win-sets make agreement more likely; 3) Smaller Level II win-sets strengthen the leader; 4) Leaders can try to influence the size of the win-sets at home and abroad
- Therefore, domestic politics complicates all international bargaining

Constructivism

- **International politics is international interaction**
- Interests: Depends on the institutions and interactions
- Institutions: Depends on the interactions
- Interactions: Constantly in flux, change is constant, power of norms and discourse, importance of identity, meanings depend on behavior and interpretation

Feminist Theory

Interests: 

- Don’t forget to think about ALL the actors involved in the functioning of states, organizations movements
- Who participated in decision-making?
- Who are we ignoring?

Institutions: 

- Gender stereotypes as a kind of institution we should be aware of and how they structure interests and interactions
- Is anarchy replaced by patriarchy?

Interactions: 

- Power is way more complicated and suffuses all interactions way more then the other theories think it does.

Postcolonial Theory

- Interests: 
- Institutions: Many rules of the system were designed to perpetuate established power dynamics (not even-handed or designed for cooperation)
- Interactions: Race as a social construct designed for control, not objective description

## Assignment for Next Class  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

### Check the Modules page for the assignment prompt

::: notes

Next week we do your final paper!

<br>

Canvas: Paper 3 - Select your Event (8 pts)

Find a NEW international political event you want to focus on for the final paper (NO OVERLAP in class and nothing from the omitted list on the paper 3 prompt!).

1. Submit TWO pieces of evidence that each provide the basic details of the event (APA format)

2. Explain the event you have chosen (2+ sentences)

3. Make an argument this is an "international political event" (2+ sentences) 

<br>
