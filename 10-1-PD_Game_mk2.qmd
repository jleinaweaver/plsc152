Prep for Class

1. Get ready for PD game
    
    - Reserve the extra room(s) or use Meador Center
    - Print your PD v2 notes
    
3. AFTER CLASS: Update slides for next class (10-2)

    - Current EC points from attendance sheet
    
    - Results of this game

4. Game notes
    
    - Group leaders MUST take a census (make a list of all members of their group at beginning of exercise)
    
    - You will need to record who is leader every round
    
    - Don't tell them the leader reward! Just that it is related to term in office
    
    - IMPORTANT: New groups need to mix up the PD v1 groups so the leaders have a harder task distributing points at end. More fun if inequality exists within each group

## Do Audience Costs Matter? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

![](Images/10_1-Trump_Putin.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}


::: notes

For today's class I had you read and reflect on a big ongoing debate in International Relations.

1. Are audience costs real? e.g. do they influence how leaders make decisions?

2. If they do "matter," then by how much? Is it a big or small effect?

<br>

### Per the Tomz (2007) reading, what are "audience costs"?
- (Audience costs: "...shorthand for the surge in disapproval that would occur if a leader made commitments and did not follow through" (823).)

<br>

### Do both Trump and Putin have to worry about audience costs in the same way? Why or why not?

<br>

### According to Tomz (2007) what are the premises in the argument that concludes "audience costs" are real and substantial?
1. ("hollow threats and promises undermine the country’s reputation") OR

2. ("empty commitments are dishonorable and embarrassing") OR

3. ("inconsistency is evidence of incompetence")

<br>

### According to Tomz (2007) what are the premises in the argument that concludes "audience costs" are not a serious factor in explaining leader behavior?
1. (Citizens unlikely to punish a leader for backing down because some don't pay attention to foreign policy)

2. (some focus on final outcomes not process)

3. (others willing to accept that bluffing is a good strategy even if it sometimes fails)

<br>

### Based on your submissions to Canvas today, where did you come down on this question? Do "audience costs" matter for explaining leader behavior?

<br>

I'd like us to explore this debate about the importance of leaders and audiences in international politics this week

- **SLIDE**: And to get us started I think we should play another game!

## A Competitive Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

+ A single game played across multiple rounds.

+ Each round your group must choose whether to cooperate or defect.

+ Your reward depends on the choice made by the other group.

+ Each group is a **democracy** with an **elected leader**

::: notes

Welcome to the prisoner's dilemma (mark 2)

<br>

Today's PD game has been updated to add additional elements that are crucial to thinking about international political events.

1. Each group is a democratic country with an elected leader.

2. Each round of the game is a negotiation between the two groups AND the two leaders
    - Leader's Aim: Bring points back to your group.

## Prisoner's Dilemma (v2) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r}
tibble(
  col1 = c("Group 1", ""),
  col2 = c("Cooperate", "Defect"),
  Cooperate = c("+3, +3", "+5, -2"),
  Defect = c("-2, +5", "-1, -1")
) |>
  kbl(align = c("l", "l", "c", "c"), col.names = c("", "", "Cooperate", "Defect")) |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 2, "Group 2" = 2)) |>
  column_spec(column = 1:2, bold = TRUE, width = "20em") |>
  column_spec(column = 3:4, background = "#b3ccff", width = "20em") |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 40, bootstrap_options = "basic")
```

::: notes

Here you can see I've updated the outcomes table since the last time we played.

<br>

### Everybody still clear on how to read this game board?

- The table shows four possible outcomes for each round based on the choice made by each group.

<br>

### Any questions on the game board?

- The reward: Bonus points on the final paper

<br>

Let's talk about the leaders.

**Any questions on the powers of the leader?**

- Negotiation is their option

- At the end of the game they distribute the rewards as they see fit

- Personal benefit: The longer your term, the bigger the reward

**Your Fearless (and TEMPORARY) Leader**

```

::: notes

As I said, you are each a democracy.

- Your first job will be to elect a leader using a simple majority rule (50% + 1).

- And because you are a democracy, you may replace the leader by a simple vote at any point during the game.

<br>

### Any questions on this?

<br>

### Any questions before we start playing?

<br>

*Split class in half*

- Ok, group A stay here, group B to the Poli Sci suite next door

<br>

When you get there:

1. pick your leader,

2. Leaders take a census (e.g. make a list of all citizens in your country), and 

3. Get ready for round 1

::: notes

Alright leaders, you have a list of your citizens and the points you received from the negotiation.

<br>

On Wednesday I want you to announce how you will be distributing the spoils.
