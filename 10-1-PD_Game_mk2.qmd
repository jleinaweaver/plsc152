Prep for Class

1. Get ready for PD game
    
    - Reserve the extra room(s) or use Meador Center
    - Print your PD v2 notes
    
3. AFTER CLASS: Update slides for next class (10-2)

    - Current EC points from attendance sheet
    
    - Results of this game

4. Game notes
    
    - Group leaders MUST take a census (make a list of all members of their group at beginning of exercise)
    
    - You will need to record who is leader every round
    
    - Don't tell them the leader reward! Just that it is related to term in office
    
    - IMPORTANT: New groups need to mix up the PD v1 groups so the leaders have a harder task distributing points at end. More fun if inequality exists within each group

## Do Audience Costs Matter? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

![](Images/10_1-Trump_Putin.jpg){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}


::: notes

For today's class I had you read and reflect on a big ongoing debate in International Relations.

1. Are audience costs real? e.g. do they influence how leaders make decisions?

2. If they do "matter," then by how much? Is it a big or small effect?

<br>

### Per the Tomz (2007) reading, what are "audience costs"?
- (Audience costs: "...shorthand for the surge in disapproval that would occur if a leader made commitments and did not follow through" (823).)

<br>

### Do both Trump and Putin have to worry about audience costs in the same way? Why or why not?

<br>

### According to Tomz (2007) what are the premises in the argument that concludes "audience costs" are real and substantial?
1. ("hollow threats and promises undermine the countryâ€™s reputation") OR

2. ("empty commitments are dishonorable and embarrassing") OR

3. ("inconsistency is evidence of incompetence")

<br>

### According to Tomz (2007) what are the premises in the argument that concludes "audience costs" are not a serious factor in explaining leader behavior?
1. (Citizens unlikely to punish a leader for backing down because some don't pay attention to foreign policy)

2. (some focus on final outcomes not process)

3. (others willing to accept that bluffing is a good strategy even if it sometimes fails)

<br>

### Based on your submissions to Canvas today, where did you come down on this question? Do "audience costs" matter for explaining leader behavior?

<br>

I'd like us to explore this debate about the importance of leaders and audiences in international politics this week

- **SLIDE**: And to get us started I think we should play another game!

## A Competitive Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

+ A single game played across multiple rounds.

+ Each round your group must choose whether to cooperate or defect.

+ Your reward depends on the choice made by the other group.

+ Each group is a **democracy** with an **elected leader**

::: notes

Welcome to the prisoner's dilemma (mark 2)

<br>

Today's PD game has been updated to add additional elements that are crucial to thinking about international political events.

1. Each group is a democratic country with an elected leader.

2. Each round of the game is a negotiation between the two groups AND the two leaders
    - Leader's Aim: Bring points back to your group.

## Prisoner's Dilemma (v2) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

```{r}
tibble(
  col1 = c("Group 1", ""),
  col2 = c("Cooperate", "Defect"),
  Cooperate = c("+3, +3", "+5, -2"),
  Defect = c("-2, +5", "-1, -1")
) |>
  kbl(align = c("l", "l", "c", "c"), col.names = c("", "", "Cooperate", "Defect")) |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 2, "Group 2" = 2)) |>
  column_spec(column = 1:2, bold = TRUE, width = "20em") |>
  column_spec(column = 3:4, background = "#b3ccff", width = "20em") |>
  kable_styling(font_size = 40, bootstrap_options = "basic")
```

::: notes

Here you can see I've updated the outcomes table since the last time we played.

<br>

### Everybody still clear on how to read this game board?

- The table shows four possible outcomes for each round based on the choice made by each group.

<br>

### Any questions on the game board?

- The reward: Bonus points on the final paper

<br>

Let's talk about the leaders.

**Any questions on the powers of the leader?**

- Negotiation is their option

- At the end of the game they distribute the rewards as they see fit

- Personal benefit: The longer your term, the bigger the reward

**Your Fearless (and TEMPORARY) Leader**

```

::: notes

As I said, you are each a democracy.

- Your first job will be to elect a leader using a simple majority rule (50% + 1).

- And because you are a democracy, you may replace the leader by a simple vote at any point during the game.

<br>

### Any questions on this?

<br>

### Any questions before we start playing?

<br>

*Split class in half*

- Ok, group A stay here, group B to the Poli Sci suite next door

<br>

When you get there:

1. pick your leader,

2. Leaders take a census (e.g. make a list of all citizens in your country), and 

3. Get ready for round 1

::: notes

Alright leaders, you have a list of your citizens and the points you received from the negotiation.

<br>

On Wednesday I want you to announce how you will be distributing the spoils.
