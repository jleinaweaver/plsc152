::: {.incremental}
+ Used simulations and real-world cases to define international political events,

+ Discussed the "science" of political science and the importance of theory (models),

+ Practiced critically engaging with arguments in terms of their logic, clarity and use of empirical evidence,

+ Utilized IR models to answer the question, why do wars happen?
:::

::: notes
That's an impressive amount of stuff!

### Any questions on all of that?

**Make an argument that one of the IR theories we've studied in class so far this term "best" explains the event you analyzed in Paper 1**

::: notes

Today we start on Section 3 of the class.

<br>

Rather than start with the theory of this topic, I prefer to start with practice.

+ So, let's play a game!

<br>

**SLIDE**: In a moment I'll split the class into two groups.

+ Each round your group must choose to cooperate or defect.

+ Your reward depends on the choice made by the other group.

::: notes

What do I mean by "reward"?

- Depending on how each group chooses, points are added or subtracted from your total

- At end, all positive points earned by your group will be added to your next paper as EC.

```

::: notes

Here's what I mean by saying your reward depends on the choice of the other team.

*Walk them through how to read the table*

::: notes

*Split class in half*

*Have everyone gather their stuff and head to their room*

From this moment, no communication between the groups!

No computers, no phones.

<br>

### In 5 minutes you will need to give me your decision for round 1.

Group 1 stay here, group 2 across the hall.

<br>

*Gameplay notes for you:*

- 6 rounds (x4-5 mins)
- each group send one sentence message to other group
- one final round (5 mins)
- *After final round, all back to main room*
