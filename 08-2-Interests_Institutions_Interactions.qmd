Prep for Class

1. Review canvas submissions for participation

2. Save time at end to discuss paper and outline

3. Make sure to record per round choices on table in these slides

<br>

*Opening Discussion: From this point forward students need to practice identifying international political events everyday in class. These are more than just 'things happening far away'!*

**DISCUSS: Name me an international political event that has happened since we last met as a class.**

## A Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-cloth_v3.png" .center}

<br>

+ Each round your group must choose to cooperate or defect.

+ Your reward depends on the choice made by the other group.

::: notes

Last class we simulated a Prisoner's Dilemma.

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before we discuss modeling the outcomes, let's dig into the "what happened" of it all!
:::



## A Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-cloth_v3.png" .center}

**What did you learn about yourself from the game?**

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='95%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/08_2-Individual_Stick_Figures_v2.png")
```

::: notes

Take a moment to reflect on this question.

- Get ready to report back to me what you learned about yourself.

<br>

*Let them take the lead on reporting back and then...*

<br>

**How well did you work inside your group?**

- **How did you see your role?**

<br>

**How did you personally weigh the risks and the rewards at stake in each round?**

- **Which was more important to you? Why?**

<br>

**Was this a useful simulation for learning about yourself as a political decision-maker? Why or why not?**

<br>

As a budding social scientist I hope you are always on the lookout for opportunities to connect your lived experience in the world with ideas for how the world works.

## A Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-cloth_v3.png" .center}

**What did you learn about the people on your team?**

<br>

```{r, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/07_2-The_Team.png")
```

::: notes

Your experience of the game was almost entirely a negotiation INSIDE your team, not with the other side.

- So, your direct experience gives you the most insight into your own behavior and second to that, into your team's behavior.

<br>

Take a moment to reflect on this question.

- Get ready to report back to me what you learned about yourself.

<br>

*Let them take the lead on reporting back and then...*

<br>

**Did you fall into certain kinds of roles?**

- **Were you happy about those roles? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Did everyone in your team weight the risks and rewards the same way? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Do you have a better sense of who the people on your team are after the game?**

- **e.g. a sense of their character?**

<br>

<p style="color: white;">**Does the class PD game reveal the true character of the other team's members (e.g. something about their nature, trustworthiness, reliability, etc)?**</p>

::: notes

Last big picture question!

- So, what do you think of the members of the other team?

- *Let them take the lead on reporting back and then...*

<br>

- **Do you have a good sense of who they are and what they value?**

<br>

- **How about their decision-making processes?**

<br>

**Bottom line, do you believe this simulation is a good test of a person's character? Why or why not?**

::: notes

Now I'd like us to shift from broad reflections into more focused analyses of the simulation.

<br>

We need to start by getting this research team all working from the same page.

- Before we can explain and predict, we have to agree on what happened

<br>

*ON BOARD (leave room for more columns to come)*

### 1) Give me a short description of the "event" from our PD simulation.

### - In other words, what was the "outcome" of the simulation?

<br>

### 2) What were the biggest obstacles to cooperation in the game in round 1? 

<br>

### 3) What were the biggest obstacles to cooperation in the game AFTER round 1?

<br>

### 4) In what specific ways could we change the game to make cooperation LESS likely?

<br>

### 5) In what specific ways could we change the game to make cooperation MORE likely?

<br>

**SLIDE**: Diagram the model!

**Let's build a model of this political event**

+ Interests

+ Institutions

+ Interactions

:::

::: notes

Let's all work together to try and turn all of this excellent analysis into a model of the prisoner's dilemma.

- Remember, the aim of a model is to give us a simplified map of an outcome!

<br>

Work in small groups to diagram the interests, institutions and interactions.

- Use the excellent submissions on Canvas to guide you!

<br>

Ok, let's start with the interests!

- **What did you focus in on?**

- **Who is making the key decisions here?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## A Model of the Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .smaller}

<br>

**Interests:** 

- Rational individuals pursuing "gains"

**Institutions:**

- ?

**Interactions:**

- ?

::: notes

"Rational" = Acts in accordance with transitive and ordered preferences

<br>

**What are the institutions you identified?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## A Model of the Prisoner's Dilemma {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .smaller}

<br>

**Interests:** 

- Rational individuals pursuing "gains"

**Institutions:**

- No restrictions on choosing defect or cooperate
- High uncertainty (e.g. simultaneous decisions, unknown time horizons)
- Benefits depend on choices of all actors

**Interactions:**

- ?

::: notes

Two sources of uncertainty: Unknown time horizons (how many rounds to play), simultaneous decision-making

<br>

**And what are the interactions you identified?**

- (**SLIDE**)

- Benefits depend on choices of all actors

**Interactions:**

- Biggest rewards for short-term defection OR long-term cooperation

- A risk averse actor's dominant strategy is to defect

::: notes

**Questions on the diagram?**

- **Want to make any modifications?**

<br>

As you know, Section 3 of our class is trying to answer a new question:
- Why is it so Hard to Cooperate With Other Countries?

<br>

**Based on this model, why do PD scenarios make it so hard for countries to cooperate with each other?**

- Some international problems are structured in such a way that they make cooperation very hard to achieve

- Problems that look like THIS often lead to bad outcomes EVEN THOUGH all involved would like to cooperate!

<br>

Alright let's take this out of the hypothetical world and into the real world.

**What is an international problem that is likely to represent a real world prisoner's dilemma?**

- **Brainstorm with the people around you and then report back!**

<br>

*ON BOARD*

- SHARE and DISCUSS

<br>

::: notes

We know that manmade GHG emissions are changing the climate system in some scary ways.

- We'd all be better off to reduce our emissions but the effect only significant if EVERYONE gets on board.

- If just you, then you pay the costs and others take the benefit!

<br>

A kind of prisoner's dilemma!

- Long-term were all better off cooperating on this, BUT short term incentives are to defect!

<br>

**Make sense?**

::: notes

**Given our model, what can we do to solve real-world problems that look like PDs?**

- **Brainstorm strategies to change the game!**

- (Raise the costs of mutual defection?)

- (Raise the benefits of mutual cooperation?)

- (Implement systems / oversight to deter defection?)

- (Directly pay states to cooperate?)

<br>

Bottom line, my hope is that this work today has helped you think about our simulation more deeply.

- Building models requires breaking complex situations down into their component pieces, and 

- thinking carefully about how each piece works on its own and when colliding with the other pieces.

<br>

More important than that, I hope you are starting to see how these skills connect to the real world.

- If you can get specific about the thing you are trying to explain (the outcome), thinking about the interests, institutions and interactions will help you structure ANY investigation.
    - Why do wars happen?
    - Can we stop international terrorism?
    - What should we do about famine and global poverty?

<br>

Huge questions have to be broken down into smaller pieces.

- We can then carefully examine these smaller pieces that explain some part of the outcome.

- Once we identify these causal mechanisms we can then try to alter the outcomes we care about on the global stage.

<br>

**In other words, are you starting to see how models can be used to manipulate complex social systems?**

- Scary powerful once you see the world this way...

<br>

**Any questions on this?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Paper 2 prompt
:::



## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Make an argument that one of the IR theories we've studied in class so far this term **"best"** explains the event you explored in Paper 1. 

- Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

- Options: Neorealism, Offensive Realism, Democratic Peace, Economic Liberalism, and the Bargaining Model of War

::: notes

Here is the prompt for the second paper.

- **Any questions on it?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Outline assignment due Friday
:::


## For Friday: Draft an Outline {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .smaller}

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 1: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?

::: notes

As I introduced last week, this is the outline you have due tomorrow
