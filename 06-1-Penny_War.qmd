**II. Why Are There Wars?**

- Simulating the bargaining model of war

::: notes
Prep for Class

1. Cards for bargaining game:

    - Print and cut out cards in Google Drive, OR

    - Sets of cards from multiple decks (**TEST** no aces and 2-9)

2. Bring pennies or use paper to track scores

    - 10 per student

3. Open Wednesday slides in rmarkdown for tracking results

4. Make sure to save time for one practice round for ALL students

## Why do wars happen? {background-image="Images/06_1-WW1-2_v2.png"}

::: notes

As we discussed a few weeks ago, international war is a puzzling event.

- HUGELY costly and the gains are deeply uncertain.

<br>

Let's run through the competing answers to this puzzle again!
:::



## The Neorealist Answer {background-image="Images/06_1-neorealist_world_v2.png"}

::: notes
**What is the Neorealist answer?**

- (A: Anarchy -> Fear)

- (Neorealism: States want to survive, war comes from uncertainty and the security dilemma.)
:::



## The Offensive Realist Answer {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/06_1-Offensive_world.webp")
```

::: notes
**What is the Offensive Realist answer?**

- (A: Anarchy -> Great powers must pursue regional hegemony)

- (Offensive realism: Powerful states want hegemony and war comes from the pursuit of it!)
:::



## The Liberal Institutionalist Answer {background-image="Images/06_1-ICC_v2.png"}

::: notes
**What is the Democratic Peace answer?**

- Kant argues we need republican constitutions, a federation of free states and hospitality to all

- Clearly this model has been updated since 1800...

- A: If we could all agree on a few rules everything would be fine e.g. republican democracy and respect for sovereignty (in other words, anarchy is bad but we can deal with it!)
:::



## The Economic Liberal Answer {background-image="Images/06_1-global_rules.jpg"}

::: notes

**What is the Economic Liberal answer?**

- (Trade -> specialization -> peace)

1) Where states are self-sufficient they will not be transformed by trade and therefore might still view war as a means to grow economically.

2) Where resources are limited and rules do not exist, conflict over those resources is still likely.

## The Bargaining Model of War {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png"}

```{r, fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/06_1-kennedy-khruschev2.png")
```

::: notes

This week we jump forward in IR theory by a few decades!

<br>

James Fearon in 1995 published an article titled, "Rationalist Explanations for War."

- In it he offers a really interesting model of war as a bargaining process.

- Two sides with opposing goals each trying to get what they want without having to pay too high a cost to get it.

<br>

My plan for today is that each of you experience the dynamics of the model before we analyze it on Wednesday.
:::



## Simulating the Bargaining Model {background-image="Images/background-triangles_grey_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

- Two players fight each other five times

- Your "strength" depends on your cards

- Your "resources" are measured in pennies

- Objective: Have the most pennies at end of round 5

:::

::: notes

*Review details on slide*

Everyone starts the game with 10 pennies and playing cards.

<br>

Ok, how do we play?

- **SLIDE**: Let's step through one round of the game

```

::: notes

**1. Ante up.**

- Both players ante up 1 "penny" into the pot, and draw three cards from their deck.

- The penny you pay to start represents the cost of running your country

**2. P1 Choice: Give up or fight!**

- If P1 concedes, P2 gets the pot and the round ends

- If P1 demands the pot (war), P2 gets a choice...

**3. Choice shifts to P2: Give up or fight!**

- If P2 concedes, P1 gets the pot and the round ends

- If P2 resists, you go to war!

```

::: notes
**4. War**

If both players declare war:

- Cost of war: You have to pay for the tanks and losses to your economy!

- Show your cards, stronger side wins

<br>

Each round you'll alternate being P1 and we'll play five rounds.

::: notes

**Let's practice this once real quick, everybody pair off!**

<br>

Shuffle your cards, pay the ante and THEN draw three

**Does everybody now have 9 pennies and three randomly chosen cards in their hands?**

<br>

*Make everybody on your left of each pair P1*

**What's the strongest hand you can have in this game?**

- 24

**And the weakest?**

- 9

<br>

Alright, P1s you all decide your hand is strong so you declare war!

- Declaring war doesn't cost you a penny, only going to war does!

- Decision shifts to P2

<br>

P2s, you look at your hand and decide its pretty darn strong too!

- You declare war right back!

<br>

Both sides pay the costs of war!

<br>

**Is everybody now holding three cards and only 8 pennies?**

<br>

**Ok, who wins the pot?**

<br>

**Everybody clear on how to play the game?**

::: notes

Let me be super clear here.

- This simulation is meant to help us unpack the bargaining model of war

- To do that I need you to take it seriously.

<br>

Your goal in this game is to have the most pennies at the end of five rounds.

<br>

**Questions on the game?**
:::




## Simulating the Bargaining Model {background-image="Images/background-triangles_grey_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Find an opponent

2. Make sure you have 10 pennies + 8 cards

3. Complete five rounds, and 

4. **Write down how many wars you fought**
:::

::: notes

Alternate who is P1 each round and keep score.

Ok, play the game.

*Back to our seats!*

<br>

Each pair tell us your final score and how many wars you fought.

Ok, let's change it up this time.

- Everybody make sure they have ten pennies

- Change partners and get ready to play again.

- THIS TIME, Keep ONE card face up each round.

- Start of game: Pay the ante, draw your cards and randomly reveal one of them to your opponent.

## Assignment for Next Class {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read Fearon (1995)

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 

    - Who do you think are the key interests, and what are the key institutions and interactions in Fearon's Bargaining Model of War?

    - Were there any specific parts of Fearon's article that you found confusing?
