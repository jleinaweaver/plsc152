## Assignment for Today {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

### Find an international political event from the last six months that you find interesting and would like to explore more deeply.

::: notes

This week we work on your first paper!

- Prompt: Find an international political event from the last six months that you find interesting and would like to explore more deeply. Your selected event must be framed as a specific actor taking a specific action against a specific target. Your first paper must make an argument that it is important we understand why this event happened.

<br>

Our pre-class assignment prompt should have helped us collect a bunch of possible answers to the question.

- Let's start off by reviewing all the submissions on Canvas.

<br>

**Any APA citations need to be cleaned up?**

- Remember, the goal here is to help each other.

- You're not calling anybody out!

- We want everyone to format correctly!

## What is HIGH QUALITY evidence? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

Now let's talk high quality evidence.

**What does it mean to say a source or piece of evidence is high quality?**

<br>

- (Focus on the "initial appraisal" section from the "Critically Analyzing Information Sources" reading.)

- (High quality evidence:)
    - Author: Credentials, Affiliation, Frequently cited by experts
    - Date: Up-to-date is preferred
    - Edition or revision: Multiple editions imply demand; Revisions imply being kept up-to-date
    - Publisher (if book): University press
    - Title of journal: Scholarly journal

- ("Scholarly or peer-reviewed journal articles are written by scholars or professionals who are experts in their fields. In the sciences and social sciences, they often publish research results.")

<br>

My two-cents: The Engle piece is a little too hung up on quality "flags" like degree earned and publisher

- High quality evidence should have the same qualities we expect from our own arguments

- Is it logical, clear, credible, and critical?

<br>

Keep in mind, the quality of the evidence at least **partially depends on what you are using it to do**.

- **SLIDE**: Let's put this big idea into practice

## Assignment for Today {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Find an international political event from the last six months that you find interesting and would like to explore more deeply.**

<br>

Is the event:

- international?

- political?

::: notes

First things first, let's make sure everyone has selected an international political event.

<br>

**Refresh my memory, how did we define these key concepts in class?**

<br>

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Find an international political event from the last six months that you find interesting and would like to explore more deeply.**

<br>

The event must:

- Be a thing or happening from the past, 

- Have a global impact or involve more than one state,

- Impact community decision-making, resource distribution or how rules are made or enforced

- Must be explainable as actor X took action Y on date Z

::: notes

*Split class into small groups (x3)*

<br>

Small groups: Review each case and evaluate two things.

1. Is the case an international political event per these definitions?

2. Is this a past event and is it specific (e.g. actor X taking action Y on date Z)?

3. Is the provided evidence sufficient to support the argument that it is all three of these things?

<br>

### Questions on the task?

Get to it!

<br>

### Anybody have an example of a case that might not meet all three definitions? Let's discuss them!

<br>

### Does everybody have evidence that is high enough quality to make the case this an international political event?

- I'm guessing yes!

- Establishing basic facts? Newspaper/new report is probably sufficient.

## Assignment for Today {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Find an international political event from the last six months that you find interesting and would like to explore more deeply.**

<br>

Evaluate the submitted evidence

- Is this high quality enough to establish the basic elements?

::: notes

Time to do the harder thing!

Small groups: Present the importance argument to each other and evaluate the evidence provided.

- Is the evidence high quality enough to convince you that this intl pol event is IMPORTANT?

<br>

### Questions on the task?

Get to it!

<br>

### Did everybody have evidence that was high enough quality to support this argument?

Much higher threshold!

- Evidence quality depends on aim of the argument

- Using someone else's argument? Better be built on peer-reviewed research.

<br>

Is everybody clear on how evidence quality is incredibly important but depends on the context of the argument?

- The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1991.

    - The NYT works!

- The Berlin Wall coming down signaled the end of the Cold War and transformed US-Soviet relations

    - You better go get some HIGH quality academic sources and examples to support that argument!

## Paper 1 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

What is the most important international political event to occur in the last six months?

- Your selected event must be framed as a specific actor taking a specific action against a specific target. 

::: notes

Here is the prompt for your first paper.

### Questions on the prompt?

<br>

Everybody write a thesis statement that presents your chosen event as the central argument of a paper.

- Let's have everybody start with a super formulaic, but very clear style

- e.g. Event X is an important international political event because...

<br>

Let's hear them all and give each other feedback!

## For Next Class {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. Read Farrell (2010)

2. Submit 10 possible premises for your argument

:::

::: notes

1. Read Farrell (2010)

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - Your CHOSEN answer, and
    
    - Brainstorm a list of 10 premises supporting your importance argument

<br>

The Farrell (2010) reading is all about how to write a political science paper.

- Super helpful advice in there!

<br>

Your assignment is to brainstorm ten reasons your chosen event is an important one for us to better understand.

- I know this sounds like a lot of reasons, but I want you to push yourself to build a big list of possible premises.

- You're going to narrow down to three or four in the end, but we want to intentionally start very broadly.
