Prep for Class

1. Review cases submitted to Canvas

2. Bring markers x 3

3. Be ready to share video of your case on YouTube [Link to the Tuvalu foreign minister's statement standing in the water](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBBsv0QyscE?&autoplay=1)

<br>

Today I want to briefly introduce you to a second strand of critical IR theory: Postcolonial Approaches to IR

- These scholars focus on the effects of colonialism and race on international political events

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's refresh our work on critical IR theory from the last two weeks

::: notes
**Based on the Enloe reading, how does a feminist approach to IR theory push us to think differently about the interests, institutions and interactions that matter for explaining international political events?**

- *Force this discussion*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we shift to a new set of case studies to discuss and reflect on!

:::





## Assignment for Today  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

1. Find a current, or recent, international political event that **explicitly deals with issues of colonialism, exploitation by the strong against the weak or race**

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - The APA citation for your evidence, and
    
    - A short explanation for why this case illustrates an under-explored issue in international politics
    
[My Case...](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBBsv0QyscE?&autoplay=1)

::: notes
I'd like to follow a similar approach today to how we used case studies as our first steps into feminist IR theory.

- I think it's incredibly useful to begin discussions like this from a real-world perspective.

- If we can identify a type of real-world case that our current theories fail to explain well then that will help us understand what a new theory needs to do to be useful.

<br>

Like last time I'll kick you off with mine!

<br>

My research recently has focused a great deal on the dynamics of the ongoing global climate change negotiations

- Each year the world's countries get together to negotiate and plan at the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings

- You will not be surprised to hear that the developed world, e.g. rich countries, hold a great deal of influence over how those negotiations progress and what they produce

<br>

So, what do you do if you are a small country facing extinction to raise your voice above the din?

- Play video linked on slide

<p style="color: white;">**How can the developing world make its voice heard in global climate change negotiations?**</p>

::: notes
Foreign Minister Simon Kofe of Tuvalu submitted a video statement to COP 26 (Nov 2021) while standing in the ocean

<br>

I grant you, this photo that his government released to the media undermines the seriousness of his message

- But this event importantly tries to remind us of the real world consequences facing millions around the world, and

- Asks us to reconsider how we've organized our global negotiations and how we set priorities of action for those negotiations

## Postcolonial Case Studies {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. What is the "event"?

2. Why is it "international"?

3. Why is it "political"?

4. Why did you choose this case? (e.g. colonialism, exploitation, race, etc?)

5. What are the implications of this case for IR theory?

::: notes

Ok, I want each of you to analyze your own case using these prompts

- Take a few minutes to make sure you could introduce your case as an answer to these five questions

<br>

*Split class into 3 groups*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board!

<br>

Today I want us to reflect on the role of gender in international political events.

- I'm going to ask each group to develop and present a series of arguments

- **SLIDE**: Argument 1

:::



## Postcolonial Case Studies {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- ?

- ?

- ?

### Therefore, we cannot usefully explain THESE specific international political events without analyzing the role of race / exploitation

::: notes

Ok groups, share your events with each other and then build an argument on the board

- The conclusion of that argument is: we cannot usefully explain these specific international political events without analyzing the role of race / colonialism / exploitation

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Argument 2
:::



## Postcolonial Case Studies {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- ?

- ?

- ?

### Therefore, we cannot usefully explain ANY specific international political events without analyzing the role of race / exploitation

::: notes

Ok groups, now I want a second version of your argument

- The conclusion of that argument is: we cannot usefully explain ANY specific international political events without analyzing the role of race / colonialism / exploitation

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our next question...
:::



## Can these models of IR be used to "accurately" explain our cases from today? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

+ Neorealism

+ Offensive Realism

+ Bargaining Model of War

+ Liberal Institutionalism

+ Economic Liberalism

+ Two-Level Games

+ Constructivism

::: notes

*Encourage debate*

- Strongest reasons why?

- Strongest reasons why not?
:::



## How difficult would it be to add these dynamics to these theories? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

+ Neorealism

+ Offensive Realism

+ Bargaining Model of War

+ Liberal Institutionalism

+ Economic Liberalism

+ Two-Level Games

+ Constructivism

::: notes

*Discuss*

<br>

### Is this an explicit argument in favor of Constructivism? Why or why not?

<br>

**SLIDE**: All that said, gender may be so central to the experience of human societies that we have no choice but to redesign our theories of IR.

## Assignment for Next Class  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Vucetic and Persaud (2018) on race in International Relations

2. **Before class** submit to Canvas: 
    - What do Vucetic & Persaud mean by "race" in this reading? How does their definition of the concept compare to how "race" is used in the world around us?
