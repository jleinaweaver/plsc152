2. NOTE: Made tweaks before class FA23 and created a saved version of prior plan with replay of game ("SAVE-04-3-Offensive_Realism.Rmd")

3. Markers x 4

**Any new international political events catching your eye this week? What's going on out there?**

::: notes

Last class we began exploring the next section of our class: Why Are There Wars?

<br>

**Refresh my memory, why is this a puzzling question?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Section 2 of the class

:::


## Section 2: Why Are There Wars? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- **Neorealism**

- Offensive Realism

- Liberal Institutionalism

- Economic Liberalism

- Bargaining Model of War

::: notes

Let's refresh our work from last class:

<br>

**What does it mean to say that scientific models are like maps? What does that mean is true of all the models on this list?**

<br>

So, all of these models are simplifications of reality that are neither true nor false

- HOWEVER, we hope that they are useful for explaining and predicting international political events

<br>

Last class I introduced you to interests, institutions and interactions as a way to diagram and analyze a model.

- **Refresh my memory, what are the "interests" in a model?**

- **What are the "institutions" in a model?**

- **What are the "interactions" in a model?**

<br>

**Ok, put this all together for me, what is the map of international political events provided by neorealism?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## Neorealism (Waltz 1988) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Unitary states want security, not power

**Institutions**

- International anarchy

**Interactions**

- You must fend for yourself (threats are everywhere)
- Security dilemmas dominate

::: notes

**Name an international political event that this model explains really well.**

<br>

**Name an international political event that this model does NOT explain well.**

<br>

**Overall, what are the strengths and weaknesses of this as our model of international politics?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Today we shift to a competing model called Offensive Realism
:::



## Offensive Realism (Mearsheimer 2001) {background-image="Images/05_2-putin_with_gun_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Let's diagram the model!

+ Who are the key interests?

+ What are the key institutions?

+ What are the primary interactions that matter?

:::

::: notes

On your own, 5 mins, diagram Neorealism as an answer to these three questions

- Force yourself to write this down!

- It's way harder, and much more productive, when you have to put pencil to paper

- Go!

<br>

Ok, consolidate diagrams with the person next to you

- Get ready to report back your diagrams

<br>

**Ok, pairs, who are the interests in offensive realism?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## Offensive Realism (Mearsheimer 2001) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Great powers seeking hegemony

**Institutions**

- ?

**Interactions**

- ?

::: notes

**Clarify this for me, how is this first assumption different from neorealism?**

- (Not all states matter for explaining international political events)

- (Not about security, but hegemony, e.g. the pursuit of regional dominance)

<br>

So, Mearsheimer looked at neorealism and thought, world politics is driven by the most powerful states pursuing power, not all states worried about survival.

<br>

**Ok, pairs, who are the institutions in offensive realism?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::



## Offensive Realism (Mearsheimer 2001) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Great powers seeking hegemony

**Institutions**

- International anarchy

**Interactions**

- ?

::: notes

The same!

- This is probably what most closely unites the two theories as "realist"

<br>

**Ok, pairs, who are the interactions in offensive realism?**

- (**SLIDE**)

:::




## Offensive Realism (Mearsheimer 2001) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Interests**

- Great powers seeking hegemony

**Institutions**

- International anarchy

**Interactions**

- Great powers have offensive military capacity
- Attack may come at any time (uncertain intentions)
- Weakness invites attack (rational opponents)

::: notes

So, for Mearsheimer world politics are not a security dilemma, they are driven by powerful states constantly seeking advantage over their neighbors!

<br>

Before we dig into the theory, let's explore the idea of "greatness" here

- *Split class into groups of 5*

- Go sit with your group!

- **SLIDE**
:::



## Who are the great powers? {background-image="Images/05_2-justice-league2_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

On the Board:

1. Make a list of the characteristics of a "great" power

2. Give us ten countries that pass your test

:::

::: notes

Groups I want you to put two things on the board:

1. Create a list of criteria that make a country "great", and

2. Name 8 countries that meet your definition of "great"

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- *PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

:::



## Criteria of Great Powers {background-image="Images/05_2-justice-league2_v2.png" .center}

<br>

::: {.r-fit-text}

Waltz, K. (1979). *Theory of International Politics*. McGraw-Hill.

- **Size of population & territory**

- **Resource endowment**

- **Economic capability**

- **Military strength**

- **Political stability and competence**

:::

::: notes

Here is Kenneth Waltz’s criteria for qualifying as a "great power."

- **Whose list is better, his or ours? Why?**

<br>

**Can everybody see how this is a huge problem for this theory?**

- (No single definition of “great” or “powerful” will be appropriate in all contexts.)

<br>

**Given that defining a "great power" is so problematic, why in the world might someone prefer offensive to neorealism?**

<br>

1) We prefer simple models to more complex ones

- Fewer moving parts means easier to apply.

- Need less information / time to make predictions

- Less room for measurement error to mess up how your model works

<br>

2) While "great" is debatable, most definitions identify the same countries

- If you expand the list enough it gets hazy, but identifying the absolutely most powerful states isn't that hard to do.

<br>

3) Offensive realism allows us to make different predictions than the others

- **SLIDE**: Let's talk about how!

<p style="color: white;">**Offensive Realism**</p>


::: notes

Offensive realism covers essentially the same ground as neorealism.

- Makes sense given the shared assumptions about unitary states and anarchy.

- However, they disagree fundamentally about who matters and what they want

<br>

**So, in what specific ways would offensive realism make different predictions from Neorealism?**

<br>

OR emphasizes "power maximization" as an expectation rather than just stopping with the security dilemma.

- OR's argue "power maximization" is the logical conclusion from their argument

- It means that the ultimate goal of every great power is hegemony

- Mearsheimer defines hegemony as a state of total domination
    
<br>

**Why does Mearsheimer argue great powers MUST pursue hegemony? Why not stop when you feel safe?**

1. (Hard to assess relative power.)

    - I can’t tell precisely by how much I am stronger or weaker than you.

2. (Even harder to project into the future.)

    - Across time I can’t know how our powers’ will change.

<br>

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

And I just want to show you, Mearsheimer understands the implications of his theory.
