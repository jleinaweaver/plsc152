Prep for Class

1. Review cases submitted to Canvas

2. Bring markers x 3

3. Your Case: Patel, Kasha. (2021, Nov 8). How climate change is disproportionately affecting girls in low-income countries. *The Washington Post*. [LINK](https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/11/08/cop26-girls-education-climate-weather/)

<br>

Over time a series of "critical" approaches to International Relations have developed and I'd like us to explore one of them this week.

- Specifically, this week we explore international political events using a Feminist approach to international relations

## Assignment for Today  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Find a current, or recent, international political event that **explicitly deals with issues of gender**

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - The APA citation for your evidence, and
    
    - A short explanation for why this case illustrates a gender issue in international politics

::: notes
Before we dig into the approach I'd like us to build up to it starting with case studies.

- I think it's incredibly useful to begin discussions like this from a real-world perspective.

- If we can identify a type of real-world case that our current theories fail to explain well then that will help us understand what a new theory needs to do to be useful.

<br>

For today I asked each of you to go find us a real-world case that includes an important gender dynamic.

- I meant this to be very broad, so I'm super curious to see what you brought in.

<br>

**SLIDE**: I did the exercise too, so let's kick this off with my case!

As you may or may not know, my research tends to focus on international problem-solving using policy

- I'm fascinated by instances of the global community trying to solve a massive problem simultaneously at the domestic and international levels.

<br>

One particular policy challenge I have been studying for a long time is the disproportionate impacts of climate and weather catastrophes

- In short, what should we do when countries experience disasters not of their own making?

<br>

**SLIDE**: And that led me to this story

What is the event?

- Just before the 26th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change a weather disaster struck Malawi (muh-laa-wee)

- Specifically, a severe storm destroyed the schools in a number of villages

<br>

Why is this international?

- Research growing in confidence that climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events

- So, countries are being made to pay dearly for the behavior of other countries

<br>
    
Why is this political?

- Many of the poorest countries who contributed almost nothing to the problem are being hit the hardest.

- Countries with limited resources have to make VERY difficult decisions about where to spend to prevent this damage and where to spend to fix the damage

<br>

Why is gender important here?

- Per UNESCO, before the storm, Malawi (muh-laa-wee) ONLY enrolls about 37% of eligible students in secondary school

- In Malawi (muh-laa-wee), when serious storm damages occur, girls are:

    - Often kept home to save money for food, 
    
    - Expected to work in the fields or by gathering water from long distances, or 
    
    - Married off to older men.

<br>
    
So, bottom line: 

- Behavior by other countries creates damage for the developing world,

- Developing world climate damages disproportionately harm women and girls

- Harm to women and girls in the developing world tends to harm the growth potential for these countries

- THEREFORE, we CANNOT explain development in the developing world without analyzing gender!

<br>

**Does this case make sense?**

## Gender Case Studies {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}

1. What is the "event"?

2. Why is it "international"?

3. Why is it "political"?

4. What is the role of "gender" in this event?

5. What are the implications of this case for IR theory?

:::

::: notes

Ok, I want each of you to analyze your own case using these prompts

- Take a few minutes to make sure you could introduce your case as an answer to these five questions

<br>

*Split class into 3 groups*

- Go sit with your group and claim some space on the board!

<br>

Today I want us to reflect on the role of gender in international political events.

- I'm going to ask each group to develop and present a series of arguments

- **SLIDE**: Argument 1

:::



## Gender Case Studies {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- ?

- ?

- ?

### Therefore, we cannot usefully explain THESE specific international political events without analyzing the role of gender

::: notes

Ok groups, share your events with each other and then build an argument on the board

- The conclusion of that argument is: we cannot usefully explain these specific international political events without analyzing the role of gender

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Argument 2
:::



## Gender Case Studies {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- ?

- ?

- ?

### Therefore, we cannot usefully explain ANY specific international political events without analyzing the role of gender

::: notes

Ok groups, now I want a second version of your argument

- The conclusion of that argument is: we cannot usefully explain ANY specific international political events without analyzing the role of gender

<br>

**Questions on the task?**

- Go!

<br>

*PRESENT and DISCUSS each*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Our next question...
:::



## Can these models of IR be used to "accurately" explain our cases from today? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

+ Neorealism

+ Offensive Realism

+ Bargaining Model of War

+ Liberal Institutionalism

+ Economic Liberalism

+ Two-Level Games

+ Constructivism

::: notes

*Encourage debate*

- Strongest reasons why?

- Strongest reasons why not?
:::



## How difficult would it be to add a gender dynamic to these theories? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

+ Neorealism

+ Offensive Realism

+ Bargaining Model of War

+ Liberal Institutionalism

+ Economic Liberalism

+ Two-Level Games

+ Constructivism

::: notes

*Discuss*

<br>

### Is this an explicit argument in favor of Constructivism? Why or why not?

<br>

**SLIDE**: All that said, gender may be so central to the experience of human societies that we have no choice but to redesign our theories of IR.

## Assignment for Next Class  {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Read Enloe (2014)

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - What are the strongest critiques of international relations made by Enloe (2014)?

::: notes

For Wednesday I want you to read the first chapter of an intriguing book by Cynthia Enloe that explores the arguments we have begun today.

<br>

In short, the question for you as you do the reading is, in order for us to be better students of global politics:

- How should we approach gender dynamics?

- Do our theories need to change?

- Does our media coverage of global politics need to change?

<br>

### Questions on the assignment?
