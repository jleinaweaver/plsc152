Prep for Class

1. **FORCE the groups to sit together! Leaders sit up front!**

2. BEFORE CLASS update slides

    - Update group choices from last class
    - Update group members and current EC

3. **Run slides on laptop IN CLASS and, at the start of class, REMOVE anybody who doesn't come to class today from member list (no attendance, no citizenship, no points)**

4. YOU need to decide the leadership rewards AFTER hearing how much each valued being the leader

<br>

*Set up the leaders to make their big announcement but then make them wait until after we discuss everything!*

- *If they ask about leader rewards tell them "that comes later"*

<br>

On Monday we re-played our prisoners' dilemma from a few weeks ago but with a few added wrinkles.

- Before we dig into what happened, the leaders have a job to do.

- **Leaders are you ready to announce your decisions?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Before you announce your decision, let's talk about the simulation

**Ok, what happened?**

- **What is your best description of the "outcome" of our simulation?**

<br>

**Is this an example of a successful interaction or not? Why?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Let's dig into this

In trying to explain the outcome of our game we also have to consider the history

- We've played this style of game before in this class

<br>

**How did the history of our class simulations impact your approach to the game?**

**SLIDE**: Let's talk power!

## Explaining the Outcome {background-image="Images/10_2-Decision_v2.png"}

::: notes

Let's also consider how the individuals, e.g. non-leader citizens, influenced the game 

<br>

**Citizens, how powerful did you feel in this game?**

<br>

**What specific elements of the simulation existed to grant you power in the game?**

1. Advocate for policy

    - You know what the group should do this round, help them understand!

    - The leader isn't listening or succeeding, let's pick a new one!
    
3. Vote

    - Time to make a hard choice!

**Did you personally make use of these tools? Why or why not?**

**Citizens, bottom-line, to what degree did you feel control over the leader of your group? Why?**

## {background-image="Images/10-2-powerful_leader.jpg"}

::: notes

Ok, leaders, your turn!

<br>

**Leaders, how powerful did you feel in this game? Why?**

- **What was the most fun part about being in charge?**

- **What was the least fun part?**

<br>

**Citizens, do you agree with their perceptions? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Leaders, how did our domestic institutions impact your approach to being leader?**

- **In other words, how did you think about the 50%+1 rule as a constraint on your behavior?**

<br>

Let's talk for a sec about the impact of different kinds of domestic institutions on this simulation

<br>

Imagine you were the leader of a healthy, egalitarian style democracy

- That means the right to vote is guaranteed to all citizens, 

- your elections are free and fair, and

- there are extensive checks and balances on your power

<br>

Add it all up and let's say that this means your plan to distribute the bonus points must be accepted by a super-majority of your citizens or it will not happen

- **If the leader had to get 75% yes votes from the group, how would that influence the points distribution?**

<br>

Now, imagine you are the leader of a competitive authoritarian country. 

- The right to vote is restricted using threats and red tape,

- Your voting districts are organized to benefit your own party (extreme gerrymandering),

- You use a masked police force to punish your political enemies and threaten dissenters, 

- You have bent the media to your control, and 

- You use your access to tax money to reward your friends and family

<br>

Add it all up and let's say that this means your plan to distribute the bonus points must be accepted by only a small sliver of the population

- **If the leader only had to get yes votes from 25% of the population, how would that influence the points distribution?**

<br>

**So, is everybody clear how domestic institutions in this game matter A TON?**

<br>

**And which one of those hypotheticals describes America today?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: We can't discuss the leaders without also talking about the negotiations

:::



## Explaining the Outcome {background-image="Images/10-2-How-to-negotiate-a-deal.jpg"}

::: notes

**Did the negotiations play a significant role in explaining our outcome? Why or why not?**

<br>

**Did you trust your own leader as a negotiator even though they were earning their own benefits?**

<br>

**Did you trust the word of the other team's leader as a negotiator? Why or why not?**

<br>

**SLIDE**: Enough stalling, let's divy out the treasure!

:::



## {background-image="Images/09_1-patronage.jpg"}

**Leaders, are we ready to go with this?**

- **Are you ready to reward your loyal servants?**

1. As is true in the real world, inequality exists!

    - Wealth and opportunity are not equally distributed across the population.

2. I have removed anyone who isn't in class today from eligibility

    - Not nearly awkward enough if they aren't here for it
    
3. I have highlighted all prior leaders in your group

<br>

Leaders, please take a moment to reflect on your proposal

- You don't have to make changes but I'd like you to reflect on this for a moment

- **Ready to go?**

- Please announce your decision.

<br>

**Leaders, bottom-line, if we played the game again in the future, how hard would you fight to be chosen leader?**

- *Use these answers to announce hypothetical leader rewards then invite discussion of whether these points accurately reflect the motivations of the leaders*

- *If they wouldn't, no reward (0 points)*

- *If they passed it around the room to spread "the wealth" then it wasn't valuable, was it? (0 points)*

- *If they loved it, make it kind of obscene... (5 points?)*

<br>

**SLIDE**: Alright, let's connect the dots to our next model!

::: notes
Given EVERYTHING we've just discussed and highlighted I hope you can see that there are really two outcomes of interest to this game

- Outcome 1 is how the groups interacted with each other

- Outcome 2 is how the leaders interacted with their citizens

<br>

Putnam's argument for us today is that we can't understand the international negotiation without considering the domestic game (and vice versa)!
:::




## {background-image="Images/09_2-chess.png"}

::: notes

Robert Putnam is a political scientist who wrote a great deal about modeling international negotiations.

- In a 1988 paper he introduced the concept of a two level game.

- Putnam argued that we could think usefully about international negotiations as a two level game.

<br>

I hope the excerpt from the reading made sense.

- **SLIDE**: Since it's a complicated idea, let's step through it together.
:::



## {background-image="Images/09_2-Chess_3.png" .center}

**Level I**

The international negotiation between leaders (or their representatives).

<br>

**Level II**

The leader's negotiation with constituents to accept their international deal.

::: notes

On the first level, leaders are actively negotiating with other leaders.

<br>

On the second level, leaders are actively negotiating with their supporters to stay in power.

<br>

The key is that these levels interact!
- International negotiations impact domestic politics, AND
    
- Domestic politics changes international negotiations

<br>

### Intuition make sense?

<br>

Putnam's model assumes each participant in each level has a separate "win-set."

### What is a "win-set" and how does the Level I win-set differ from the Level II win-set?
:::



## {background-image="Images/09_2-Chess_3.png" .center}

**Level I Win-Sets**

The range of outcomes the leader would accept in the international bargain.

<br>

**Level II Win-Sets**

The range of outcomes that could be ratified by domestic institutions.

::: notes

Difference between a Level I and a Level II "win-set"? (435-437)

### Everybody clear on the win-set concept?

- **SLIDE**: Let's tackle the ideas in this paper in smaller chunks!
:::



## {background-image="Images/09_2-Chess_3.png" .center}

1. Why do "larger win-sets make Level I agreement more likely"? (437-439)

2. Why do leaders benefit from having small Level II win-sets? (440-441)

3. How do Level II preferences/coalitions explain win-set size? (442-448)

4. How do Level II institutions explain win-set size? (448-450)

5. How do Level I negotiators strategies explain win-set size? (450-452)

::: notes

*Split class into five groups*

Ok groups, take a few minutes and get ready to answer this question for the class!

- Groups: Answer the question for us and identify how this aspect played out in our simulation last class.

<br>

1. Why do "larger win-sets make Level I agreement more likely"? (437-439)
    - The wider the range of acceptable agreements to each leader, the more flexibility they can offer to the other side
    - Remember, each leader has to worry about selling the international deal back home!
    - So, bigger win-sets more likely a deal can be found both sides believe can be ratified

2. Why should leaders benefit from having smaller Level II win-sets? (440-441)
    - Large level 2 win-sets invites "pushing you around"
    - Other negotiators don't have to care as much about your needs/wants/desires if you can get anything ratified
    - Ironically, domestic weakness may produce international strength!

3. Explain how the size of the win-set depends on Level II preferences
and coalitions (442-448)
    - You have to get the deal ratified so international negotiations depend to a large extent on the domestic battles over power, leadership and policymaking.
    - Remember, domestic constituents are not choosing between your deal and a different one. They choose between your deal and no deal. Leader not as weak as you might have thought.
    - What proportion of your constituents are open to international deals? Internationalists
    - Homogeneous vs heterogeneous conflicts

4. Explain how the size of the win-set depends on Level II institutions (448-450)
    - US Congress requires 2/3 vote in Senate, that's a very high threshold
    - Majoritarian parliamentary systems, lower threshold
    - Dictatorship with centralized control and no opposition, smallest still

5. Explain how the size of the win-set depends on Level I negotiators strategies (450-452)
    - Negotiators are not powerless to adjust the bargaining outcome
    - Side-payments help!
    - Increasing popularity of the deal at home ("good will")

Talk me through the spat between the UK and France described in our NYT article.

### What is the international political event here?

<br>

### Use the Putnam Two-level Game metaphor to help me understand what is going on here.

<br>

### What does Macron actually want from this interaction?

#### - Is it about fish? Nuclear subs? Or something else?

<br>

### What does Boris Johnson want?

<br>

### Is this strong evidence that domestic politics matters for understanding international outcomes? Why or why not?
