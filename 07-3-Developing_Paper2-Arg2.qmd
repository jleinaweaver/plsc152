Prep for Class

1. Bring markers x 4

2. Timings
    - Groups: Diagram models we've covered thoroughly and practice applying all (30 mins)
    - Groups: Diagram bargaining model (10 mins)
    - Review assignment for NEXT Friday (5 mins)
    
3. Options for applying the models
    - Find and assign a current event from today's paper, OR
    - Have the class apply each model to their own Paper 1 events

<br>

**SLIDE**: Paper 2 prompt

## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Make an argument that one of the IR theories / models we've studied in class so far this term is **the most useful explanation of the event you explored in Paper 1**. 

Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

- Options: Neorealism, Offensive Realism, Liberal Institutionalism, Economic Liberalism, and the Bargaining Model of War

::: notes

Here is the prompt for the second paper.

### Any questions on it?

:::



## {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

::: {.r-fit-text}
**Models of International Relations (so far)**

- Neorealism

- Offensive Realism

- Liberal Institutionalism

- Economic Liberalism

- *Bargaining Model of War*

:::

::: notes

*Split class into 4 groups*

Groups each take one of the models from class so far and get a diagram up on the board

- **NOT INCLUDING the bargaining model!**

<br>

GROUPS:

1. Diagram your model on the board, and then

2. Make sure each of you can use THAT model to explain your international political event

    - Help each other!

<br>

**Questions?**

- Get to it!

<br>

GROUPS, move to the next theory diagram

1. Any edits needed to the model diagram?

2. Make sure each of you can use THAT model to explain your international political event

<br>

*REPEAT x 2*

<br>

**SLIDE:** Bargaining model time

<br>

*NOTES*

Neorealism

- Interests: Unitary states want security, not power
- Institutions: International anarchy
- Interactions:
    - You must fend for yourself (threats are everywhere)
    - Security dilemmas dominate

Offensive Realism

- Interests: Great powers seeking hegemony
- Institutions: International anarchy
- Interactions:
    - Great powers have offensive military capacity
    - Attack may come at any time (uncertain intentions)
    - Weakness invites attack (rational opponents)

Liberal Institutionalism

- Interests: Unitary, rational states pursuing absolute (not relative) gains
- Institutions: International anarchy PLUS international institutions (e.g. laws and organizations)
- Interactions: International institutions can help to overcome cooperation dilemmas, reduce uncertainty, distribute benefits

Economic Liberalism

- Interests: States want growth
- Institutions: International anarchy (States may choose to start wars or seek trade)
- Interactions
    - War is risky and disrupts trade
    - The returns to trade grow over time
    - Specialized economies are dependent on trade for growth
    - Therefore, increasing trade should reduce the occurrence of war.

GROUPS, now tackle the Bargaining Model of War!

## Bargaining Model (Fearon 1995) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Interests**

- Rational actors pursuing relative gains

**Institutions**

- ?

**Interactions**

- ?

::: notes

Rational actors have preferences, can rank their preferences and act in line with those preferences

<br>

Relative gains follow from the other Fearon assumptions

- Two risk-averse or risk-neutral actors (or sides),

- Dispute on a single dimension,

- Winner of the war chooses the outcome position,

- Amount you like the outcome increases across the line,

<br>

**Interests**

- Rational actors pursuing relative gains

**Institutions**

- International anarchy: States may choose war or a bargain

**Interactions**

- Wars are costly, risky and inefficient
- War occurs because of private information / incentive to misrepresent
- War occurs as a consequence of commitment problems
- War occurs due to "issue indivisibilities"

::: notes

Expectations

- Because wars are costly, risky and inefficient, there should ALWAYS be a non-war outcome that both sides would prefer.
- Therefore, war occurs because of private information and the incentive to misrepresent.
- Therefore, war occurs as a consequence of commitment problems.
- Therefore, war occurs due to "issue indivisibilities"

<br>

GROUPS, give this theory a test run as well!

- Practice using it to explain each of your events

- Help each other do it!

**SLIDE**: Outline due next Friday
:::





## Outline Due NEXT Friday {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 1: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?

::: notes

Everybody pick your two theories and get to work applying them to your Paper 1 event!

- Outline due in class next Friday

- Paper due in two weeks

<br>

With the rest of our time today you have work to do:

1. Select the theories you will be evaluating, 

2. Brainstorm how to apply that theory to your case, and then

2. Write a draft thesis statement!

<br>

### Questions?

- Get to it!
