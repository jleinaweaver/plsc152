Prep for Class

1. Timings
    - Groups: Diagram models we've covered thoroughly
    - Groups: Diagram bargaining model
    - Review paper prompt and assignment for NEXT Friday (10 mins)
    
2. WHILE the groups work on first diagrams go find current events in the news. Ask each group to present their model and use it to explain the event.

## Paper 2 {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Make an argument that one of the IR theories / models we've studied in class so far this term is **the most useful explanation of the event you explored in Paper 1**. 

Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

- Options: Neorealism, Offensive Realism, Liberal Institutionalism, Economic Liberalism, and the Bargaining Model of War

::: notes

Here is the prompt for the second paper.

### Any questions on it?

:::



## IR Models (so far) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

- Neorealism

- Offensive Realism

- Liberal Institutionalism

- Economic Liberalism

- *Bargaining Model of War*

::: notes

*Split class into 4 groups*

Groups each take one of the models from class so far and get a diagram up on the board

- **NOT INCLUDING the bargaining model!**

<br>

GROUPS:

1. Diagram your model on the board, and then

2. Make sure each of you can use THAT model to explain your international political event

    - Help each other!

<br>

**Questions?**

- Get to it!

<br>

GROUPS, rotate through the four theories practicing applying each to their events

<br>

**Any clarifications needed?**

**Interests**

**Institutions**

- ?

**Interactions**

::: notes

GROUPS, now tackle the Bargaining Model of War!

- DIAGRAM on the BOARD!

<br>

PRESENT and DISCUSS each

- **SLIDE x 3**: Reveal my version...

## Bargaining Model (Fearon 1995) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Interests**

- Rational actors pursuing relative gains

**Institutions**

- ?

**Interactions**

- ?

::: notes

Rational actors have preferences, can rank their preferences and act in line with those preferences

<br>

Relative gains follow from the other Fearon assumptions

- Two risk-averse or risk-neutral actors (or sides),

- Dispute on a single dimension,

- Winner of the war chooses the outcome position,

- Amount you like the outcome increases across the line,

<br>

**SLIDE**: Institutions

:::

**Interests**

- Rational actors pursuing relative gains

**Institutions**

- International anarchy: States may choose war or a bargain

**Interactions**

- ?

## Bargaining Model (Fearon 1995) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

<br>

**Interests**

- Rational actors pursuing relative gains

**Institutions**

- International anarchy: States may choose war or a bargain

**Interactions**

- Wars are costly, risky and inefficient
- War occurs because of private information / incentive to misrepresent
- War occurs as a consequence of commitment problems
- War occurs due to "issue indivisibilities"

::: notes

Expectations

- Because wars are costly, risky and inefficient, there should ALWAYS be a non-war outcome that both sides would prefer.
- Therefore, war occurs because of private information and the incentive to misrepresent.
- Therefore, war occurs as a consequence of commitment problems.
- Therefore, war occurs due to "issue indivisibilities"

<br>

GROUPS, give this theory a test run as well!

- Practice using it to explain each of your events

- Help each other do it!

<br>

**SLIDE**: Outline due next Friday
:::





## Outline Due NEXT Friday {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 1: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?

::: notes

Everybody pick your two theories and get to work applying them to your Paper 1 event!

- Outline due in class next Friday

- Paper due in two weeks

<br>

With the rest of our time today you have work to do:

1. Select the theories you will be evaluating, 

2. Brainstorm how to apply that theory to your case, and then

2. Write a draft thesis statement!

<br>

### Questions?

- Get to it!
