## Final Exam (Due May 6, 10am) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Select a **NEW** international political event and make an argument that one of the IR theories / models we’ve studied in class this term “best” explains the event. 

- Your paper must include a counter-argument that applies and evaluates a second theory to the case.

- No double-dipping on realism/liberalism

- At least one theory from the second half of class

- No events used in the prior paper

::: notes

**Questions on the assignment?**

<br>

For today you have each:

1. Broken your event down into its key components: Who is the actor? What is the action they performed that you are explaining?

2. Briefly explained the event using THREE of the theories from class

<br>

Let's get and give feedback!

- *Split class into groups of three*

- Go sit with your group

<br>

By the end of class today you should have:

- An international political event to explain supported by high quality evidence

- A simple explanation of the event using three models of IR, and

- A start on the strengths and weaknesses of each model applied to your event

**Focus on one paper at a time (15 mins)**
:::

1. Is it clear what specific actor and action is being explained?

2. Is each theory applied correctly?

3. Help them decide: Which theory is most useful and why?

::: notes

Focus on each paper for 15 minutes (use all the time!)

- Review their event and their use of the three models to explain it

- Help them brainstorm strengths and weaknesses for each model applied to this event

<br>

**Questions on the assignment?**

- I'll tell you when to move to the next paper

- Go!

## For Friday: Outline {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center .smaller}

**Intro**

- What is the question?
- Why is the question important?
- Thesis statement: Theory X is most useful because...

**Premise 1: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 2: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Premise 3: Theory 1 is most useful because... (with evidence)**

**Counter-Argument: Theory 2**

- What are the strengths of this explanation?
- What are the weaknesses of this explanation?
- Why is it not ultimately more useful than Theory 1?
