::: notes

On Monday we ran a simulation in class to help us think carefully about the causes of war.

<br>

Here are the overall results from our simulation.

- The x-axis represents the number of wars fought by one pair of students.

- Each bar counts the number of pairs in each category.

<br>

### Does the visualization make sense?

<br>

### So, what do we see here in overall results?

- `r sum(da$Wars == 0)` pairs fought zero wars in their five rounds together.

- `r sum(da$Wars == 5)` pairs fought in all five rounds they played together.

- Out of `r nrow(da)` pairings and `r nrow(da) * 5` possible conflicts we observed `r sum(da$Wars)` wars.

- So, `r round(sum(da$Wars)/(nrow(da) * 5), 3) * 100`% of the time your conflicts led to war.

Remember we use models to explain international political events

- And we can break most IR models into three components: interests, institutions and interactions

- So, let's use these outcomes as a puzzle for us to explain.

<br>

### How can you explain why we saw `r round(sum(da$Wars)/(nrow(da) * 5), 3) * 100`% of the rounds end in war?

- Talk to the person next to you and get ready to report back to me how some specific interests, institutions, or interactions explain this outcome

<br>

*REPORT BACK and put ON BOARD*

Interests

- Maximizing resources (pennies) vs a desire for murder!
- Objective framed in relative gains / zero-sum

Institutions

- Social acceptance of violence?
- No chance for allies to help
- Odd number of rounds?
- How many cards in my "deck"?
- Sum vs avg?

Interactions

- Uncertainty!
    - I don't know what you have in your hand
    - I don't know your level of risk acceptance
- Do people play differently in first round than in the second?
- Do people play differently in the lead than being behind?
- How did revealing cards change the game?

Research Question?
:::

::: notes

Today we pair that simulation with the research that inspired it, Fearon's (1995) article on the bargaining model of war.

<br>

Let's start where we always should: The Research Question!

- In this case, the question is also a bit of a puzzle.

<br>

### What is Fearon's big research question?

### - What are the three reasons he argues war should be unappealing as a strategy to get what you want?

(**SLIDE**)
:::



## Fearon (1995) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

**Research Question**

If wars are **costly**, **risky** and **inefficient** why do they happen?

::: notes

**According to Fearon why is war costly?**

- (Costly: Requires resources to fight)

### According to Fearon why is war risky?

- (Risky: You might lose, no guarantees)

### According to Fearon why is war inefficient?

- (Inefficient: Fighting is costly, bargains are not (or are less so))

<br>

This is a huge first assumption in this paper, so let's evaluate it.

### Are you persuaded that war is costly, risky and inefficient? why or why not?

<br>

### Any current events examples we could draw on?

(US 20 year war in Afghanistan?)
- Destabilization of the region
- Distraction away from other global threats
- Has created fractures with our allies in NATO
- Has committed us to HUGE expenses over time as we pay medical care and retirement for the many, many Americans who served.
- Higher taxes / more debt
- Crowds out spending on economic growth
:::




## Fearon (1995) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

![](Images/06_2-Fearon_Figure1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

::: notes

This brings us to Fearon's aim: Why does war happen if we all agree that war is a super messy way to get what you want.

<br>

This figure essentially summarizes Fearon's model of the "go to war" decision by states.

<br>

Keep in mind this is a model (e.g. a map) and like all models/maps it is a simplification of reality.

- There are two states having a dispute, A and B

- The possible outcomes of their dispute are represented by this line

<br>

Whatever outcome they reach represents a point along this line

- A prefers outcomes closer to 1, B closer to 0.

- Don't stress about the letter variables here, we'll explore the bargaining intuitions in a moment.

<br>

Let's start with just these elements that set the stage.

### What are the key assumptions in this model? 

### - In other words, as a "map" of war, what does Fearon choose to focus on?
:::


## Fearon (1995): Key Assumptions {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

![](Images/06_2-Fearon_Figure1.png){style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

1. Only 2 actors, 

2. Dispute on a single dimension, 

3. Winner of the war chooses the outcome position, and

4. Amount you like the outcome increases across the line.

::: notes

Let's reflect on this as a model for a sec.

<br>

### When you think about a state's decision to go to war, how well does this set of assumptions cover the elements you think would be important?

### - Leaving anything important out? Why or why not?

*encourage this discussion*

<br>

Ok, let's now talk about the bargaining dynamics in the model.

The first pirate knows that for 20 gold he can buy a gun that will allow him to take all of the treasure.

- It gives him a 100% chance of winning the fight.

<br>

### At that moment, before the gun is purchased, is there any amount of gold the second pirate could offer the first to avoid being killed?

(81 gold!)
- The treasure is worth 100 gold but the gun will cost 20 which nets you 80 gold.
- 81 gold > 80 gold

**Does that make sense?**

<br>

### So, what is the first really important thing this model helps us understand about the decision to start a war?

(**SLIDE**)
:::



## Why is the model useful? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

1. Winning Reward = Treasure - Costs of Fighting

![](Images/06_2-Fearon_Figure1.png)

::: notes

Actual Outcome = Treasure - Costs of Fighting

- Here we see how the cost of war becomes a factor in our decision-making.

- The greater the cost of war, the less appealing it is as a tool for getting what you want.

- The important part isn't necessarily the outcome, it's the cost of obtaining it.

<br>

Also, this isn't just a vague expression, the model helps us think precisely about how the impact is felt.

### Make sense?

<br>

### How could we have tested this by modifying our simulation on Monday?

(Increase the cost of going to war and see what happens!)
- I'm guessing many fewer wars!

That's just cost, now let's talk about risk.

Imagine the gun for sale is actually an old flint lock pistol.

- Both inaccurate and hard to reload.

- Let's say this gun actually gives the first pirate a 50% chance of winning the fight.

<br>

### At that moment, is there any amount of gold the second pirate could offer the first to avoid him buying a gun?

**And now what does this mean for the decision to go to war?**

- If Pirate B offers Pirate A 31 gold he can avoid being shot!

- The guaranteed 31 gold outweighs the costs + the risks of the war.

<br>

### And what does this mean is the second important reason this model is useful?

(**SLIDE**)
:::



## Why is the model useful? {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

1. Winning Reward = Treasure - Costs of Fighting

2. Expected Outcome = p(Winning Reward) + p(Losing Reward)

![](Images/06_2-Fearon_Figure1.png)

::: notes

Expected Outcome = p(Winning Reward) + p(Losing Reward)

- Risk magnifies the costs of war in significant ways!

- And now we see how the model helps us understand the role risk plays in lowering the attractiveness of war.

<br>

### Make sense?

<br>

### How could we have tested this by modifying our simulation on Monday?

- (More cards in your hand?)

- (More cards in the deck, e.g. 1-50?)

- (Increase the punishment for losing, e.g. lose half your remaining points?)

2. Dispute on a single dimension, 
3. Winner of the war chooses the outcome position,
4. Amount you like the outcome increases across the line,
5. States must know there is a probability of victory, 
6. Leaders are risk-averse or risk-neutral, and
7. The issues at dispute must be divisible.

<br>

### Ok, what are Fearon's conclusions?

### - If his model is useful, why do wars keep happening?
:::



## Fearon (1995): The Argument {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

**Argument 1**

- Therefore, war occurs because of private information and the incentive to misrepresent.

**Argument 2**

- Therefore, war occurs as a consequence of commitment problems.

**Argument 3**

- Therefore, war occurs due to "issue indivisibilities"

::: notes

Fearon draws out three big hypotheses from his bargaining model.

<br>

### How does our game from Monday illustrate the first argument?

### - How does private information and misrepresentation play a role in the start of costly wars?

<br>

### How does our game from Monday illustrate the second argument?

### - How do commitment problems increase the likelihood of costly wars?

<br>

### How does our game from Monday illustrate the third argument?

### - How do "issue indivisibilities" increase the likelihood of costly wars?

<br>

Finally, let's connect all of this to the real world.

### BRAINSTORM: How does all of this help us reduce the onset of war?

- The UN?
- Increasing transparency of arms sales?
- ?

<br>

### Bottom line, how convinced are you by Fearon's model?

### - Is it better than the alternatives he considers? Why or why not?
e.g. anarchy, preventive war and positive expected utility

<br>

### Does this model change how you think about war and international politics? Why or why not?

### - Any concerns or limitations?

## Assignment for Next Class {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

1. Hultman, Kathman & Shannon (2016) on United Nations Peacekeeping (p231-238)

2. **Before class** submit to our Canvas discussion board: 
    - What is the research question in this paper?
    
    - Diagram the model in this paper (e.g. interests, institutions and interactions)

::: notes
Next class we dig into a research paper that explores the effect of the United Nations on war.

- Your job is to read the set-up of the paper (231-238) so we can explore the model they propose to test.
