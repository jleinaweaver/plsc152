<br>

Postcolonial IR theory pushes us to think more broadly about the "interests" in our models

- It aims to take seriously the experiences of people in the non-western or less developed parts of the world.

- In this way, broadening the 'interests' in our models, postcolonial IR has something in common with the feminist work we read last week

<br>

**In a big picture sense, are we convinced that the experience of international politics in the developing world is different than that of the developed world?**

It seems like the world is full of examples consistent with this key observation.

- Not all countries experience "international politics" in the same way

<br>

Israel, as a lonely democracy in an autocratic part of the world, gets support and backing from powerful western countries

- When those autocratic regimes threaten it, the West steps in

- The US government condemned the Israeli strike on the Iranian generals, and YET we STILL sent armed forces into position to protect the Israelis AGAINST Iran!

<br>

On the other hand, Haiti's experience with the international community has been brutal and awful

- A LONG history of international interference

- First it was the destabilizing slave trade and colonization

- Then frequent undermining of its attempts to rebuild itself

- **SLIDE**: And even the multilateral events that tried to help may have made things much worse

knitr::include_graphics('Images/14_1-Haiti_Cholera_UN.png')
```

::: notes

Postcolonial IR theory is a warning to us that if we want to explain international political events we need to consider these crucial differences.

- Liberal institutional theory tells us the UN can facilitate cooperation and make the world more peaceful and stable

- The experience of Haiti, and many other developing countries, raises some serious caveats to that story!

<br>

In order to take these postcolonial experiences seriously, these researchers argue we have to turn a critical eye to the concept of "race."

- Everybody open up our Canvas discussion board and review the submissions for today.

- Talk to the people around you and get ready to report back...

- **Based on the Vucetic and Persaud (2018) reading you did for today, what is "race"? Define the concept**

+ a product of racism

+ a reflection of power

::: notes

Hot damn that's a huge argument!

<br>

These researchers are asking us to accept that "race" is not a fixed thing that exists in the world

<br>

IF this is correct, then your race is NOT defined by your genetics or any other immutable characteristic of who you are

- It is a fluid concept invented by the powerful in society to protect and preserve their power

**SLIDE**: This is a big conclusion, so let's unpack the argument they are making before I ask you to reflect on it.

#### Notes Below
+ Definition of "race" fluid across time
    + Sometimes refers to: ‘civilization,’ ‘spirit’, ‘blood’, ‘’nature’, ‘culture’, OR all of the above at once" (11).
    
+ "Biological racism" (e.g. racism based on the color of your skin) arose to justify the slave trade.
    + "...an effort to affix the indigenous peoples in the Americas and Africa as non-human or less-than-human indistinguishable from livestock for the purposes of their enslavement, dispossession, exploitation and extermination (11).

+ "Scientific racism" develops "a standard of civilization" test to adapt racism to a new age
    + "...a pseudo-scientific body of thought that in essence sought to prove the inherent superiority of the cultures and races of the West" (11).
    + A conceptual-legal yardstick invented by "the West" that took its own standards and approaches to development as the determiner of civilization and progress. 
    + Staggering: In the 19th century "no colonial intervention could take place without a ‘civilization debate’—that is, on whether the target area can be, or should be, civilized through colonization" (13). "As architects of modern international order, white Europeans considered only themselves to be competent to adjudicate the civilization of others" (14).

+ Many examples of historical Western powers using the "standards of civilization" test
    + Haitian Revolution (1791-1804) as example of how white supremacy was central to European thinking about the world. "...most European intellectuals at first refused to believe it. The notion that a successful slave revolt—on this island alone the colonizers had previously quashed at least eight such revolts—could give birth to an actually existing and radically revolutionary black polity in the New World island was simply unthinkable to them" (14). "This is why no other colonial power with interests in the Caribbean supported Haiti over France; in fact, the colonial powers scrambled together to prevent similar revolutions from occurring elsewhere" (15).
    + The post-WW1 "mandate system" meant to transfer German and Ottoman colonies to new sovereign authorities (the winners of the war) continued to use the established "standard-of-civilization schema"
    
+ Racism driving state actions up to the present day
    + "In many ways, racialization is as central for understanding state sovereignty, migration and borders today as it was a century ago (Klotz 2017; also see Box 2)" (16).
    + "...and these foundations later influenced "UN trusteeship systems (Toussaint 1956: 2-3) and thus today’s international state-building debates (Sabaratnam 2017: Ch: 2)" (16).
    + Trump's ‘Muslim ban’, a new ‘voter fraud’ commission, refusals to condemn Nazism and neo-Nazis, etc.
    + A growing use of "mandatory and indefinite detention for asylum seekers" across “advanced liberal democracies”
:::


## Race in Global Society (p11-16) {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

+ "Race" sometimes means "civilization," "spirit," "blood," "nature," "culture" and any combination too

+ "Racism" has evolved and adapted to the times (from biological to pseudo-scientific standards of civilization)

+ Tons of examples across history and into the present day of states using race to maintain or extend their power

Therefore, "race" is a tool invented by the powerful in order to control, exclude and exploit the less powerful.

::: notes
**On the whole, is this a logical argument?**

<br>

### Does it provide sufficiently high quality evidence for its premises?

<br>

### Bottom line then, is this a convincing argument? 

### - Are you convinced "race" is an invention not tied to any fixed "truth" about you? Why or why not?

<br>

Ok then, assuming we accept definition of "race," how does it help us explain international political events?

- The next two sections of the chapter aim to introduce us to the research on the intersection of race with economic development and international security.

**Chapter Notes**

- "Immediately following WWII three major historical developments started almost simultaneously, namely, decolonization, the Cold War, and the dramatic rise of the United States as the unofficial leader of the Western world. All three of these global phenomena had major impacts on economic development, and all three were also implicated in **actually existing racism** that followed WWII" (19).

- "The sustained anti-immigrant politics in the West which is dependent on the Third World for both ‘cheap’ and high-tech labor is not only a fetter on economic growth, but also a matter of massive insecurity for immigrants and migrant workers (see Box No.3)" (20).

- "The first concerns the right of the Third World states and peoples to govern themselves. Discourses from the late nineteenth century were replete with the widespread belief in the Western world that colored people were not ready for self-government, and certainly not for leadership. The belief was itself ensconced in notions of Western white supremacy, and led to aggressive imperialism with the American military intervention in the Philippines, and the already well-known scramble for Africa" (21).

- "...the widespread notion that the Third World is a late comer to modern life, meaning here a combination of capitalist economics, individualism, and ways of life. ... The work of Max Weber and W.W. Rostow, though not racialized, did however formulate a temporal model which has allowed other thinkers to treat the Third World as kind of a left behind deformity, bogged down by backward cultures. At times, the racialization has been expressed in religious terms as in the aforementioned claim by Harrison that Latin America has been held back because of Catholicism" (22).

- "For one thing, like Euro-America before it, China is now practicing its own form of colonialism in Africa, much of it under the guise of economic development" (22).

**Chapter Notes**

- Example: "When nineteenth- and twentieth-century colonial agents conducted censuses of the local population and related research, they did so with imperial security in mind but what matters more are the new insecurities they created. Typically, the colonized peoples were enumerated and classified through a mix of interviews with local elites and the methods of scientific racism—skin color assessments and physiognomic measurements, some of which were done via photographs (Metcalfe 1995). In this process race was in fact grafted onto the intertwined and highly context-dependent local identities—caste, tribal, regional and religious—and the result was a system of knowledge that at once confirmed white supremacy and forced new divisions and discord on the colonized" (24).

- "In World War II, the ‘war without mercy’ in the Pacific, like the treatment of ‘lower races’ as soldiers, prisoners of war, workers, and objects of strategy can all be regarded as continuations of the inter-racial politics that began in previous centuries (Dower 1986; Horne 2004)" (26).

- "US race laws, and not just those associated with the Jim Crow regime in the South, impressed and inspired Nazi jurists in the 1930s" (26).

- "Race has had a devastating impact in terms of security relation broadly defined" (31).

- "In international relations, ‘security’ has traditionally focused on the military and economic security of mostly European great powers. This, too, has to do with a Eurocentric conception of the world" (22).

- Empire as a key concept: "For postcolonial scholars, many analytical goals in this area revolve around structural power, that is, around the question of how empires produce political, cultural, and social subjectivities" (24).

::: notes

All that said, I want to end today by highlighting one other important reason international relations needs to take these criticisms seriously.

<br>

Let's not beat around the bush, Henderson (2013) and many other scholars have sought to convince us of two things:

<br>

FIRST, racism is CENTRAL to the birth, development and current research product of International Relations

<br>

**SLIDE**: AND SECOND...
:::



## Henderson's (2013) Argument {background-image="Images/background-worldmap4.png" .center}

<br>

Therefore, most of the current IR theories cannot be used to produce meaningful research or policy for the "vast majority of the world's people" (90).

::: notes

Holy crap!

<br>

Our goal as social scientists is to explain the world using models and data.

- In IR we aim to explain international political events.

<br>

Last week, Cynthia Enloe was pushing us to use our established tools to explore more stuff, to be more curious about the world!

- Power matters in more places than we realize!

- The experiences of more people are important to understand how foreign policy is made and shaped.

<br>

Henderson is definitely NOT arguing we need to apply our tools in more places or to more people.

- He's arguing that our tools themselves are broken.

<br>

If we apply our current tools of IR to ignored peoples, races or places all we create are more inaccurate explanations!

- Because IR research was built on racist foundations, the use of our models reinforces the racism in our global system.

<br>

It's a super tough article, so I didn't assign it.

- However, it is on Canvas if you're curious.

::: notes

With our time left today I'll present some of the highlights from the Henderson article so we can talk through the implications of this argument for IR today.

<br>

Henderson's paper presents a fairly damning history of how racism was deeply embedded in the birth of international relations as an academic discipline.

<br>

Take for example one of the most widely read IR academic journals, Foreign Affairs.

- As V&P also note, this was not it's original name.

Needless to say, the table of contents and these articles do not make for a pleasant read.

- At the time, the Journal of Race Development was the central corpus of scholarship

- The research in this journal placed race at the centre of the study of world politics

- It advocated or acknowledged a ‘racialized and biological understanding of “development”’.

<br>

In other words, IR started from a place that assumed your biology (e.g. skin color) determined your ability to be successful or civilized.

**Race Appreciation and Democracy**

Philip Ainsworth Means
:::
::::

::: notes

After WWI the IR research in this journal got even more problematic

- Shifted its focus from endorsing biological racism to raising alarms about a possible race war

- The articles argued the teeming masses of nonwhite peoples were becomingly increasingly assertive (e.g. ‘race conscious’)" and this would lead to war.

<br>

So, not a great start.

- Ok, IR scholars in the 20's were fixated on race but not in useful or helpful ways.

<br>

How does this matter for us in this class?

- The problem is that these racist roots still exist in some of the foundational assumptions we use in models today.
:::



## {background-image="Images/05_1-Hobbes_quote.jpg"}

::: notes

Hobbes is essentially the father of modern Realist theory.

- Essentially, Hobbes felt justified in arguing for a strong central government in order to protect us from a state of nature.

<br>

The problem is that his expectations about the violence of the "state of nature" are ahistorical.

- The examples he draws from are made-up tales about "the savage people in many places of America" who live according to their "natural lust" and in a "brutish manner."

- He contrasted these made-up stories with his experience of Europe where he argued rationality guided behavior of the "white" races.

<br>

Why is this a problem for modern Realists?

- His empirical examples of why the "state of nature" is dangerous were not at all true, and

- The "state of nature" premise evolves to become the premise about the dangers of international anarchy.

- Why should his nasty and brutish state of nature operate at the international level if it doesn't operate at the domestic level?

"...the embarrassing fact for the white West (which doubtless explains its concealment) is that their most important moral theorist of the past three hundred years is also the foundational theorist in the modern period of the division between Herrenvolk and Untermenschen, persons and subpersons, upon which Nazi theory would later draw" (Mills 1997, 72).

**So, what does this mean for IR theories in the liberal tradition?**

<br>

Liberal IR theories are all built on the idea that institutions, and especially democracy, could be used to achieve peace on the global level.

- But the theoretical framework by which those institutions could do their work DEPENDED on maintaining white supremacist views of personhood and citizenship!

<br>

Jay-sus!

<br>

So, what does this mean for us?

- A big question with no easy answer

- My hope over the last two weeks was to get you thinking about how different perspectives on international politics can help deepen our understandings of international political events.

- Ultimately, my goal is always to be a better modeler of political outcomes and I find these theories intriguing for doing that.

**Can we think of any current events that might illustrate the power of a postcolonial IR approach to explaining the world?**

<br>

Israel's invasion of Gaza?
- Both sides justifying violence against civilians at least in part on the grounds of ethnicity and race

- Does being a Palestinian in Gaza mean you are Hamas (e.g. a terrorist to be killed)?

- Does being an Israeli near the border mean you can be slaughtered to punish the government for its policies?

- We cannot understand international political events without acknowledging race.

<br>

- It turns out, we may have a serious problem.
